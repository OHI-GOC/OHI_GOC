Hola a todos, ¡esperamos que todos estén bien!

### ¡Por favor, dinos qué piensas! Gracias.

This interactive page can be used to see, in detail, the second rough draft of subregion segmentation. The map was created based on everyone's feedback on the first rough draft of OHI Subregions.

## ***If, after reviewing the map and our questions, you have any concerns or comments about these region delineations please email us or connect with us on Zoom at one of our open office hours. This helps us move forward to the next steps!***

If you would like to meet over Zoom instead of writing an email, we will have open office hours on:

-   **need to make new times....**

### Reasoning for the New Subregion Draft {#key-questions}



# Rough Draft #1 (with 11 subregions)

![](chapters/figs/regions_subregions_drawn_ewg1.png)

```{r interactive}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| output: false
#| results: hide

library(magrittr)
library(mapview)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# for draft #1
subregions_draft_4 <- suppressMessages(st_read(here("/home/shares/ohi/OHI_GOC/spatial/subregions_drafts/june_24", "subregions_draft_2.shp"))) %>% 
  mutate(rgn_n_2 = factor(
    rgn_n_2,
    levels = paste0("Region_", sort(as.numeric(gsub("Region_", "", unique(rgn_n_2)))))
  ))

# for draft #2
poem_subrgns_ecorgn_9rgns <- st_read(here("/home/shares/ohi/OHI_GOC/spatial/subregions_drafts/poem_w_ohi_draft","poem_subrgns_ohi_9rgns_final.shp")) # WGS 84

# for poem areas to refer to
poem_valid <- st_read(here("/home/shares/ohi/OHI_GOC/spatial/subregions_drafts/poem","poem_valid.shp"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false


mapview(subregions_draft_4, zcol = "rgn_n_2", layer.name = "Subregions")
```

# Rough Draft #2 (with 9 subregions) {#interactive-map}

## POEM Areas

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false


# check OHI rgns
mapview(poem_valid, zcol = "FID_1",layer.name = "POEM Areas") 
```

## OHI Subregions

Key modifications made to POEM Areas: 

(1) POEM Area #92 was split at the Sinaloa-Nayarit state border, 
(2) POEM Area #112 was split to better align with Region_3 and Region_4, and 
(3) an additional area was added from the edge of the POEM Areas #107, #106, and #6 to Cabo Corrientes to establish the consensus southern boundary of Region_9.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# check OHI rgns
mapview(poem_subrgns_ecorgn_9rgns, zcol = "ohi_rgn",layer.name = "OHI Subregions") # YAY looks great!!!
```

## OHI Subregions by State

Showing how the new draft's OHI subregions would fit into state borders.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# show state reclassification (new_FID_state was abbreviated to nw_FID_s)
mapview(poem_subrgns_ecorgn_9rgns, zcol = "nw_FID_s", layer.name = "Estados") # looks good!
```

## OHI Subregions by Ecoregion

Showing how the new draft's OHI subregions would fit into ecoregion boundaries.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# show ecoregion reclassification (new_FID_ecorgn was abbreviated to nw_FID_c)
mapview(poem_subrgns_ecorgn_9rgns, zcol = "nw_FID_c", layer.name = "Ecoregions") # great!!
```

## Thank you all for your time! ¡Gracias a todos por su tiempo!
