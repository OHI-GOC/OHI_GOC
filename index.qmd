We are excited to announce the start of an [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) (OHI) assessment tailored to the unique concerns and priorities of the Gulf of California, Mexico.

This website will serve as a project hub where researchers and stakeholders can learn more about the OHI Gulf and California project as it develops.

A two-page summary of the project is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/190Xepljkf_QuGyCn7Egzzs-D83R5x2L3/view?usp=sharing).

The objectives of this Gulf of California OHI project are to:


- establish a baseline measure of current ocean health and provide a framework to monitor and communicate the region's condition over time.

- gather and nurture a community of engaged stakeholders from diverse backgrounds. 

- create an accessible open-source inventory of marine resources for the Gulf of California that can be built upon over time.

## What is the Ocean Health Index?
The Ocean Health Index is a framework for assessing and communicating ocean health, or, how well we are managing ocean resources to sustainably deliver benefits to people now and in the future.

During an Expert Working Group meeting held on June 2-4, we identified 9 subregions within the Gulf of California that will be assessed for the following OHI goals:

Goal | Definition, a healthy ocean provides
---------------- | ---------------------------------------
Biodiversity | A diversity of healthy marine species, habitats, and landscapes. 
Sense of place and identity | A deep sense of identity and belonging provided through connections with our marine communities
Livelihoods and economies | high quantity and quality of ocean-dependent jobs and local revenue
Food provision | Sustainably harvested seafood from wild-caught fisheries and mariculture
Tourism and recreation | Opportunities for people to enjoy coastal areas through tourism and recreation
Natural products | Sustainably harvested ocean-derived living resources for purposes other than direct human consumption
Coastal protection | Habitats provide natural protection of coasts from storm damage
Carbon storage | Habitats provide natural storage of carbon to mitigate climate change
Artisanal fishing opportunities | Opportunities for local community members to access local natural resources
Clean waters | Coastal waters are free of contaminants
Research and ocean literacy | Opportunities to learn about the marine environment of the Gulf of California (this may ultimately be included in the Sense of place and identity goal or resilience)
Safety and security | The sense that marine resources are not limited by safety concerns (this may ultimately be a pressure)

<br>
<br>

Now, the goal groups will take these next steps to develop these goals:
 
- Identify local data!
- Develop the goal models and reference points
- Evaluate outcomes!

The menu at the left provides more information about each goal. Overtime, these descriptions will be updated with information specific to the Gulf of California assessment.

## To learn more about the Ocean Health Index...


- The [oceanhealthindex.org](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) website is a good place to learn more about the OHI framework.

- This [resource](https://oceanhealthindex.org/ohi+/conduct/learn/) provides a nice readable summary of the OHI.
