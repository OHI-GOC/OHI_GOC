We are excited to announce that we are working with a team of experts to develop an [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) (OHI) assessment tailored to the unique concerns and priorities of the Gulf of California.

<br>

:::: {.columns} 

::: {.column width="50%"}

The Gulf of California OHI assessment will help achieve several important goals, including:


- establish a baseline measure of current ocean health and provide a framework to monitor and communicate the region's condition over time.

- gather and nurture a community of engaged stakeholders from diverse backgrounds. 

- establish an accessible library of key data and scientific findings.

This website will serve as a hub to communicate the status of this project. Researchers and stakeholders can come here to observe the process of creating the Gulf of California OHI, learn more about the OHI Gulf and California framework as it develops, and explore underlying data used to calculate the Index.

## A short introduction to the Ocean Health Index

::: {.column width="30%"}
The Ocean Health Index is a framework for assessing and communicating ocean health, which we define as how well we are managing ocean resources to sustainably deliver benefits to people now and in the future.


Since itâ€™s inception in 2012, we have conducted 12 global assessments and over 30 regional assessments (either independently, or in partnership us).

The original global OHI assesses 10 goals, each of which is based on a marine service or function that humans directly care about, such as jobs and food.

goals_df  <- read_csv(here("_data/output/goals.csv")) 
goals_df$subgoal <- sapply(goals_df$subgoal, function(x) 
  if (!is.na(x)) paste0(strrep('&nbsp;', 4), x) else x)

  datatable(goals_df, escape=FALSE, rownames=FALSE)
```

:::

Although 10 goals are measured for the global OHI, many regional assessments modify the number and composition of the goals based on their specific needs. The goals that are ultimately included in the Gulf of California assessment will likely differ from the global assessment, because some goals may not be relevant to the region. Alternatively, new goals, not included in the global assessment, may be developed given a region's natural resources or priorities. 

In addition to changes in the goal infrastructure, the model and data used to calculate the goals will  change because: 
 
 - Higher quality local data is usually available!

- Goal models, and reference points, can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region.  

- Goals can be weighted differently based on regional priorities.


### Goal calculations
Goal scores are mainly determined by how well the goal is performing relative to an established target, we refer to this as the goal status score.

In addition to the status score, goal scores incorporate three additional metrics: pressures, resilience, and trend. The pressures acting on a goal will reduce its score, and can include climate change or human disturbance. However, the pressures acting on a goal can be reduced by metrics that provide system resilience, such as good governance and protected areas. We also incorporate the recent trajectory of a goal's status into the final score, such that goals with improving status will have a better score, and goals with decreasing status will worsen the score.
