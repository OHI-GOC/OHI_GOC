# **Working Definition** for the BD Goal
The BD goal aims to assess the condition of local habitats and biodiversity as proxies for functionality of marine ecosystems in the gulf.

*This is a working definition, defined by the Goalkeeper Group during Meeting #3 and based on conversations during Meetings #1 and #2. See the Meeting tabs below for more details.*

*Previous working definition (as of Meeting #2): The objective of the BD goal is to assess the condition of local habitats and organismal communities that maintain productive marine ecosystems and ecosystem services.*

# About the BD Goal

Biodiversity reflects the variety of life in the ocean and the importance people place on its existence. This goal tracks how well species and habitats are being conserved, recognizing that the loss of biodiversity raises serious ecological, cultural, and moral concerns.

<div class="custom-box">
{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

This is the core definition of the *global* OHI framework.  **This will be adapted and tailored to the Gulf of California by the Goalkeeper Group.**

**Focus:** The biodiversity goal measures the conservation status of marine life, assessed through species risk of extinction and the condition of key marine habitats. It focuses on whether ecosystems can sustain the variety of species that exist today and into the future.

**Not:** This goal does not measure all aspects of nature or ecosystem health (e.g., genetic diversity, ecosystem function, or terrestrial biodiversity). It also does not capture every marine species—only those assessed through global datasets—or every local habitat, given significant data gaps.

</div>

<br> 

The global framework measures biodiversity through two equally weighted sub-goals:

1.  **Species:** Based on the global conservation status of marine species, drawing on assessments from the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International. The target is for all species to be at “Least Concern” risk of extinction.

2.  **Habitats:** Focused on the health of critical marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, kelp forests, salt marshes, tidal flats, sea ice edges, and soft-bottom habitats. These ecosystems are used as proxies for the many species that depend on them.

Data limitations remain a challenge, but we use the best available global information to assess both current conditions and recent trends. By combining species and habitat results, the biodiversity goal aims to provide a snapshot of how well marine life is being sustained, and highlights where conservation efforts are most needed.

**And hopefully, there are even better ways to measure the regional biodiversity of the Gulf of California!**

*"A General Circulation Model paper that predicts: "a general warming trend across the Gulf (SST), characterized by an increased frequency of extreme heat events and  prolonged summers.  Although note that the warming rate differs in location depending on which model is used. The Midriff Islands region and the Northern Gulf are the most resilient to climate change, due to tidal forces dominating over everything else (something we’ve all known for a very long time).

*"When you look at that report you may be surprised to see all the “critical” ratings. I was an assessor for that report [...] and I disagreed with some of those “critical” ratings, and I also disagreed with the overall “critical” rating for the site.  In my opinion, the overall assessment was inordinately driven by the vaquita situation, and other factors (e.g., pollution, invasive species) were overblown."*

Results predict *"global warming will eventually lead to a shift to more-or-less permanent El Niño conditions in the Tropical East Pacific (using Pliocene Epoch data as a model or analog).  However, the interesting twist is that the study also predicts little change from the impact of these warmer SSTs on upwelling and productivity patterns in the region (e.g., modern-like upwelling and productivity have persisted over the past 5 million years).  Furthermore, the extent of the East Equatorial Pacific oxygen deficient zone was actually smaller during the Pliocene than today, suggesting the current low-oxygen zones may contract (not expand) in the future."*

## **BD Meeting #1: Summary** - July 31
**Meeting #1** began with a discussion about AI meeting tools, language translation services in Zoom, and group member introductions. This was followed by a presentation and overview of the Ocean Health Index (OHI) and its application to the Gulf of California. Participants explored OHI methodology for assessing biodiversity goals, including the importance of establishing appropriate reference points and quantifying current status of biodiversity in the region. The group discussed challenges for data collection and analysis, with a focus on habitat degradation trends, and the difficulty of defining a 'healthy state' or baseline.

## **BD Meeting #2: Summary** - August 28
The main focus of **Meeting #2** was to solidify the goal definition before selecting model indicators. In this context, our ‘model’ will be a series of indicators intended to capture the definition of the goal; it will probably not be very mathematically complicated. Erica outlined the goal workflow – a six-step process from step 1 (defining the goal) to step 6 (verifying model outputs). The team discussed various aspects of BD, including environmental reference points and addressing habitat degradation while reviewing available resources. They explored challenges in defining biodiversity indicators and establishing baseline data, with discussions around using proxies and expert opinion when historical data is limited. The team engaged in a collaborative group activity to narrow in on a definition of the biodiversity goal, with plans to solidify the goal definition next meeting. The meeting concluded with a presentation by Hem and Ricardo, who discussed their forthcoming tool for querying international databases.

**Homework for BD Meeting #3:** Come prepared to finalize the goal definition and discuss possible indicators.

As much as possible, try not to let data availability constrain your definition – instead, let's try to make the definition philosophical or aspirational; we can redefine it once we've identified data constraints. Please also keep in mind that our working definition should capture the *intent* of the goal, whereas indicators represent the specific types of data we will use to quantify the goal's status. This is a subtle but important distinction. For example, the phrase "to measure ecosystem condition" is more philosophical and captures intent, whereas "the presence / absence of habitat-forming species" is more likely an indicator.

## **BD Meeting #3: Summary** - September 25
**In Meeting #3**, the group solidified a working definition for the Biodiversity Goal and discussed model indicators. The meeting began with administrative updates regarding meeting schedules and glossary contributions. After defining the BD goal, most of the discussion focused on refining biodiversity indicators and assessment methods, including discussions about habitat conditions, species vulnerabilities, and data collection approaches. The team explored various data sources and modeling techniques for assessing biodiversity, with plans to continue developing and refining these approaches at the next meeting.

*The new working definition for the BD goal is: The BD goal aims to assess the condition of local habitats and biodiversity as proxies for functionality of marine ecosystems in the gulf.*

**Plan for BD Meeting #4:** Erica will come with a preliminary BD "dummy" model for the group to think about and critique. We will continue our discussion of BD indicators, data sources, and technical reference points. **Please come prepared to discuss the indicators you feel are most promising (given data availability), and suitable technical reference points.** 

Keep in mind that a technical reference point for each indicator will be critical as it is essentially a goal "baseline". The closer or further away we are from the technical reference point according to some indicator X, the higher or lower the BD score will be. So, if an indicator does not have a technical reference point associated with it, it will be difficult if not impossible for us to parameterize it within the goal model. *This means that while some indicators of biodiversity might be important, we won't be able to use them if we cannot determine an appropriate reference point.*

# Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## EWG Meeting #1: Regional Considerations for BD

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.**

### Data and Monitoring

* The GoC is megadiverse with data available from a database merging Rick's invert Desert Database, CONABIO, GBIF, OBIS, totaling 12,000 species, augmented by eDNA to more than \~25,000 species including polychaetes.
* The database is georeferenced and includes spatial and depth information.
* Sampling is every 2-3 years, not continuous; historical data exist.
* Presence and abundance data cover the last 10 years.
* Optical character recognition is used to digitize paper data.
* Occurrence data have dates but are confounded by sampling effort.
* Bycatch data from Sinaloa documented 30 years ago; shrimping decline may affect diversity.
* eDNA databases are being used to collapse diversity into trophic levels for comparison through time and space.
* Naturalist and community-based databases can supplement scientific data.

### Species and habitat condition

* Proxy of status based on management; trend data are hard because repeats are needed and there are many gaps.
* Experts know from experience how species are doing and where; expert assessment would be beneficial.
* Presence/absence over time can indicate if the system is healthy or degraded.
* Need to add a richness measure beyond just status in risk assessment.
* May want to restrict to certain phyla rather than all of them.
* Indicator groups of families and species could identify which places in the gulf are faring better, possibly not at species level.
* Islands such as Islas Marias and Maria Madre are biodiversity hotspots and could serve as reference points.
* Terrestrial invasive species on islands are a concern; some indicators could link marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
* Trends for mangroves and salt marshes are available.
* Habitat and species cacti, including cardone and island plant species, are important.
* Seabird islands would be valuable to include.

### Ecological and environmental trends

* Changes in species richness in Puerto Peñasco: used to have every animal phylum, now only two or three.
* Some species impacted by fisheries and disease.
* Shifting species distributions and limited trend data from 15 years ago require revisiting.
* Trends in fin whales, sperm whales, orcas, and pinnipeds reflect ecosystem changes.
* Ospreys are increasing; fin whales and some dolphins are fewer and skinnier, but not necessarily identified as anthropogenic impact.
* Birds can signal environmental degradation; in South Sinaloa, Gulf of Santa Clara is important for birds but already greatly impacted/degraded.
* Loss of water depth and warming leads to changes in coastal lagoon ecosystems, e.g., mudflat with no shrimp or fish but birds feeding on invertebrates.
* The Colorado River basin has lost native biodiversity.

### Conservation and management

* Refugio Pescero Popular in Sinaloa is a protected area free of fishing, supported by fishermen.
* COBI supports bottom-up protected areas based on fishing groups with a consultant portal.
* Management is bureaucratically difficult.
* Artificial reefs are considered a good idea.
* Management interventions should be included in assessments.
