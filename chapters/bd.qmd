## BD **Meeting #1: Summary**, Resources, & Next Steps
**Meeting #1** began with a discussion about AI meeting tools, language translation services in Zoom, and group member introductions. This was followed by a presentation and overview of the Ocean Health Index (OHI) and its application to the Gulf of California. Participants explored OHI methodology for assessing biodiversity goals, including the importance of establishing appropriate reference points and quantifying current status of biodiversity in the region. The group discussed challenges for data collection and analysis, with a focus on habitat degradation trends, and the difficulty of defining a 'healthy state' or baseline.

**Resources shared during Meeting #1**

- [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c7PHidzwKTyiUAjSRDrsgXOQgQQHZpPUXjqYRD5wOII/edit?usp=sharing)
: learn more about Ocean Health Index, the goals of this project in the Gulf of California, and objectives for the Goalkeeper Group.
- [**Meeting #1 Summary & General Notes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFH2GoHWF_8XMBelkLNQp0xbIPvyZNyFzFERgjGNWrU/edit?usp=share_link)
: catch up on meetings you missed and review meeting summaries; keep track of resources and data bases shared during our meetings, and write down your quick thoughts offline.

*Resources shared during our meetings can be accessed in the group's shared google drive* [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JyiiyMa41FiYwM-l8rVXM1lPkMiWl6TH).

**In Meeting #2**, we will discuss how we might measure 'Biodiversity' in the Gulf, and possible BD reference points, so please come prepared for this discussion. A reference point is defined as the <u>ideal state</u> of biodiversity in the GoC.

# Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## EWG Meeting #1: Regional Considerations for BD

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.**

### Data and Monitoring

* The GoC is megadiverse with data available from a database merging Rick's invert Desert Database, CONABIO, GBIF, OBIS, totaling 12,000 species, augmented by eDNA to more than \~25,000 species including polychaetes.
* The database is georeferenced and includes spatial and depth information.
* Sampling is every 2-3 years, not continuous; historical data exist.
* Presence and abundance data cover the last 10 years.
* Optical character recognition is used to digitize paper data.
* Occurrence data have dates but are confounded by sampling effort.
* Bycatch data from Sinaloa documented 30 years ago; shrimping decline may affect diversity.
* eDNA databases are being used to collapse diversity into trophic levels for comparison through time and space.
* Naturalist and community-based databases can supplement scientific data.

### Species and habitat condition

* Proxy of status based on management; trend data are hard because repeats are needed and there are many gaps.
* Experts know from experience how species are doing and where; expert assessment would be beneficial.
* Presence/absence over time can indicate if the system is healthy or degraded.
* Need to add a richness measure beyond just status in risk assessment.
* May want to restrict to certain phyla rather than all of them.
* Indicator groups of families and species could identify which places in the gulf are faring better, possibly not at species level.
* Islands such as Islas Marias and Maria Madre are biodiversity hotspots and could serve as reference points.
* Terrestrial invasive species on islands are a concern; some indicators could link marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
* Trends for mangroves and salt marshes are available.
* Habitat and species cacti, including cardone and island plant species, are important.
* Seabird islands would be valuable to include.

### Ecological and environmental trends

* Changes in species richness in Puerto Peñasco: used to have every animal phylum, now only two or three.
* Some species impacted by fisheries and disease.
* Shifting species distributions and limited trend data from 15 years ago require revisiting.
* Trends in fin whales, sperm whales, orcas, and pinnipeds reflect ecosystem changes.
* Ospreys are increasing; fin whales and some dolphins are fewer and skinnier, but not necessarily identified as anthropogenic impact.
* Birds can signal environmental degradation; in South Sinaloa, Gulf of Santa Clara is important for birds but already greatly impacted/degraded.
* Loss of water depth and warming leads to changes in coastal lagoon ecosystems, e.g., mudflat with no shrimp or fish but birds feeding on invertebrates.
* The Colorado River basin has lost native biodiversity.

### Conservation and management

* Refugio Pescero Popular in Sinaloa is a protected area free of fishing, supported by fishermen.
* COBI supports bottom-up protected areas based on fishing groups with a consultant portal.
* Management is bureaucratically difficult.
* Artificial reefs are considered a good idea.
* Management interventions should be included in assessments.
