# **Working Definition** for the NP Goal
The objective of the NP goal is to quantify the benefits of sustainable legal harvest of commercially-important and culturally-important resources not used for food in the Gulf of California.

*This definition is finalized for now, based on conversations had in Goalkeeper Meetings #1 and #2.  See the Meeting #2 tab below for more details.*

# About the NP Goal

This goal assesses whether countries are maximizing the sustainable harvest of non-food marine resources.

<div class="custom-box">
{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

This is the core definition of the *global* OHI framework.  **This will be adapted and tailored to the Gulf of California by the Goalkeeper Group.**

**Focus:** The natural products goal measures the sustainable harvest of ocean resources—such as seaweeds, ornamental fish, shells, corals, and other non-food marine products—that people use for medicine, construction, crafts, and cultural purposes. It highlights the balance between use and long-term availability.

**Not:** This goal does not include fish and shellfish harvested for food (covered under the Food Provision goal). It also does not assess the economic value of products (Livelihoods & Economies goal), or cultural importance beyond harvest (Sense of Place goal).

</div>

<br> 

Although there are no formal sub-goals, this goal draws on several types of marine resources that people harvest for non-food purposes. In the global framework, these include:

1.  **Seaweeds and algae** – harvested for food additives, fertilizers, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

2.  **Ornamental species** – such as reef fish, corals, shells, and sponges collected for aquariums, jewelry, and crafts.

3.  **Other marine materials** – including items like corals for building materials or saguaro cacti for cultural uses.

Each component reflects a different way that people depend on the ocean beyond food. The goal measures whether these resources are being used sustainably, so that harvest today does not compromise availability in the future.

**And together, we will assess this for the Gulf of California!**

## NP **Meeting #1: Summary**, Resources, & Next Steps
**Meeting #1** introduced participants to the Ocean Health Index and its application to the Gulf of California, with Erica explaining the index's methodology and regional assessment approach. The team discussed natural products in the Gulf, exploring various potential resources and sustainability considerations, including fishery bycatch, waste utilization, and Totoaba culture. Participants agreed to gather more information about biomass sources and reference points for natural products, while exploring ways to measure and improve sustainable resource use in the region.

**Resources shared during Meeting #1**

## **NP Meeting #2 Summary** - Resources & Next Steps
The main focus of **Meeting #2** was to solidify the goal definition before selecting model indicators. In this context, our ‘model’ will be a series of indicators intended to capture the definition of the goal; it will probably not be very mathematically complicated. Erica outlined the goal workflow – a six-step process from step 1 (defining the goal) to step 6 (verifying model outputs). Participants discussed various products and their applications as well as challenges for quantification and categorization. The team worked to define non-subsistence resources and explored waste and residue indicators, with discussions on how to measure benefits and incorporate waste into the goal model. The conversation ended with a group activity focused on defining the NP goal (link to whiteboard activity below). A working definition for the goal was solidified!

# Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## EWG Meeting #1: Regional Considerations for NP

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.**

## Current status in Gulf of California
- **Development Level**: Not super well developed yet in Gulf of California
- **Potential**: Huge potential for growth despite current limited development
- **Challenge**: How to demonstrate this potential in assessment framework!

## Sustainable natural products mentioned:

### Salt production
- Generally non-destructive practice using salt flats
- **Conservation Benefits**: 
  - Provides nesting areas for shorebirds
  - Salina Lobos (medium-size plant) showing good conservation results
- Human consumption uses and industrial applications (e.g., road salt)
- *Positive* example of sustainable marine resource extraction

### Marine agriculture/industry
- **Fishmeal**: Sardines and anchovies used for animal feed production
- **Biogas**: Potential opportunity, though not always implemented
- **Composting**: Fish waste composting as potential indicator
- **Infrastructure**: Seasonal use of facilities for multiple products

### Algae products
- **Cosmetics**: Marine algae used in beauty products
- **Medicine**: Traditional and modern medicinal applications
- **Indigenous use**: Traditional medicinal products documented in research (**Nemer's paper, ask Jaqueline for this**)
- **Rhodoliths**: Harvested for heart conditions and traditional medicine

### Aquarium trade
- Limited operations (Loreto operation stopped)
- Restrictions due to protected area designations
- Individual operators previously active, but not so much anymore

## Problematic/Illegal Natural Products

### High value illegal trade
- **Totoaba swim bladders**: 
  - Used for medicine in China
  - Massive IUU (Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated) fishing problem
  - Major conservation pressure
- **Sea lion products**: Male organs exported to China
- **Shark fins**: Regulated through permits but enforcement challenges
- **Sea horses**: Part of traditional medicine trade
- **Black Coral**: Permit-regulated but potentially problematic (-AM)
- **Mangrove Timber**: Legally protected but illegally harvested
  - Creates pressure despite being renewable resource
  - Corporate restoration requirements (replant more than destroyed)

### Non-renewable extraction
- **Sand Mining**: 
  - Used for construction
  - Not renewable resource
  - Damages coastline
  - Location: Primarily in arroyos rather than direct coast

## How we could possibly group these:

1. **Sustainable Products**: Salt, some algae, regulated aquarium trade
2. **Traditional/Indigenous Products**: Medicinal algae and rhodoliths
3. **Industrial Products**: Fishmeal, biogas, composting materials
4. **Illegal/Problematic Products**: Totoaba bladders, sea lion parts, illegal timber
5. **Non-Renewable Extraction Products**: Sand mining

### However, there are seasonal considerations and regulatory challenges:

- **Protected areas**: Restricting some previously allowed activities
- **Permit systems**: Shark fins, black coral requiring official permits
- **Enforcement**: Gap between regulations and actual enforcement
- **International trade**: China market driving illegal harvesting of sea lions, shark fins, black coral, and swim bladders 

### Possible resilience?
- **Conservation co-benefits**: Shorebird nesting success in salt operations
- **Restoration requirements**: Corporate mangrove replanting compliance

### Pressure possibilities
-  Totoaba, sea lion, and other high value species illegal poaching
-  Coastline damage assessment of sand mining
-  Mangrove harvest of timber
-  International demand driving illegal activities

### Development potential was mentioned a lot!!
- Seasonal facility utilization,
- Reuse of fishmeal 
- Biogas and composting implementation
- Permit system effectiveness could increase
- Indigenous knowledge integration
