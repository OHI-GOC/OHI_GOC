## NP **Meeting #1: Summary**, Resources, & Next Steps
**Meeting #1** introduced participants to the Ocean Health Index and its application to the Gulf of California, with Erica explaining the index's methodology and regional assessment approach. The team discussed natural products in the Gulf, exploring various potential resources and sustainability considerations, including fishery bycatch, waste utilization, and Totoaba culture. Participants agreed to gather more information about biomass sources and reference points for natural products, while exploring ways to measure and improve sustainable resource use in the region.
