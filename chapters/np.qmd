## NP **Meeting #1: Summary**, Resources, & Next Steps
**Meeting #1** introduced participants to the Ocean Health Index and its application to the Gulf of California, with Erica explaining the index's methodology and regional assessment approach. The team discussed natural products in the Gulf, exploring various potential resources and sustainability considerations, including fishery bycatch, waste utilization, and Totoaba culture. Participants agreed to gather more information about biomass sources and reference points for natural products, while exploring ways to measure and improve sustainable resource use in the region.

**Resources shared during Meeting #1**

- [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SzeKI7Tg37KUQbrQ0u9Qw8UZzkOBc90z0fQTiYS-8c8/edit?usp=share_link)
: learn more about Ocean Health Index, the goals of this project in the Gulf of California, and objectives for the Goalkeeper Group.
- [**Meeting #1 Summary & General Notes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LrbOWL7UnQ2SU3u-POucAdKruhMNsFJ6rCkEMtNIqI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8562cdkt8tdh)
: catch up on meetings you missed and review meeting summaries; keep track of resources and data bases shared during our meetings, and write down your quick thoughts offline.

*Resources shared during our meetings can be accessed in the group's shared google drive* [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/11vzy2cgSxRSWaPTaHIKawYgynVozh0yl).

**In Meeting #2**, we will discuss how we might measure and assess 'Natural Products' in the Gulf, and possible NP reference points, so please come prepared for this discussion. A reference point is defined as the <u>ideal state</u> of natural products in the GoC.

# Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## EWG Meeting #1: Regional Considerations for NP

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.**

## Current status in Gulf of California
- **Development Level**: Not super well developed yet in Gulf of California
- **Potential**: Huge potential for growth despite current limited development
- **Challenge**: How to demonstrate this potential in assessment framework!

## Sustainable natural products mentioned:

### Salt production
- Generally non-destructive practice using salt flats
- **Conservation Benefits**: 
  - Provides nesting areas for shorebirds
  - Salina Lobos (medium-size plant) showing good conservation results
- Human consumption uses and industrial applications (e.g., road salt)
- *Positive* example of sustainable marine resource extraction

### Marine agriculture/industry
- **Fishmeal**: Sardines and anchovies used for animal feed production
- **Biogas**: Potential opportunity, though not always implemented
- **Composting**: Fish waste composting as potential indicator
- **Infrastructure**: Seasonal use of facilities for multiple products

### Algae products
- **Cosmetics**: Marine algae used in beauty products
- **Medicine**: Traditional and modern medicinal applications
- **Indigenous use**: Traditional medicinal products documented in research (**Nemer's paper, ask Jaqueline for this**)
- **Rhodoliths**: Harvested for heart conditions and traditional medicine

### Aquarium trade
- Limited operations (Loreto operation stopped)
- Restrictions due to protected area designations
- Individual operators previously active, but not so much anymore

## Problematic/Illegal Natural Products

### High value illegal trade
- **Totoaba swim bladders**: 
  - Used for medicine in China
  - Massive IUU (Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated) fishing problem
  - Major conservation pressure
- **Sea lion products**: Male organs exported to China
- **Shark fins**: Regulated through permits but enforcement challenges
- **Sea horses**: Part of traditional medicine trade
- **Black Coral**: Permit-regulated but potentially problematic (-AM)
- **Mangrove Timber**: Legally protected but illegally harvested
  - Creates pressure despite being renewable resource
  - Corporate restoration requirements (replant more than destroyed)

### Non-renewable extraction
- **Sand Mining**: 
  - Used for construction
  - Not renewable resource
  - Damages coastline
  - Location: Primarily in arroyos rather than direct coast

## How we could possibly group these:

1. **Sustainable Products**: Salt, some algae, regulated aquarium trade
2. **Traditional/Indigenous Products**: Medicinal algae and rhodoliths
3. **Industrial Products**: Fishmeal, biogas, composting materials
4. **Illegal/Problematic Products**: Totoaba bladders, sea lion parts, illegal timber
5. **Non-Renewable Extraction Products**: Sand mining

### However, there are seasonal considerations and regulatory challenges:

- **Protected areas**: Restricting some previously allowed activities
- **Permit systems**: Shark fins, black coral requiring official permits
- **Enforcement**: Gap between regulations and actual enforcement
- **International trade**: China market driving illegal harvesting of sea lions, shark fins, black coral, and swim bladders 

### Possible resilience?
- **Conservation co-benefits**: Shorebird nesting success in salt operations
- **Restoration requirements**: Corporate mangrove replanting compliance

### Pressure possibilities
-  Totoaba, sea lion, and other high value species illegal poaching
-  Coastline damage assessment of sand mining
-  Mangrove harvest of timber
-  International demand driving illegal activities

### Development potential was mentioned a lot!!
- Seasonal facility utilization,
- Reuse of fishmeal 
- Biogas and composting implementation
- Permit system effectiveness could increase
- Indigenous knowledge integration
