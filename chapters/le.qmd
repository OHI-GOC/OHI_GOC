**This goal measures jobs and revenue from sustainable marine-related industries.**

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITIONS**

- **Overall Goal**: Measures jobs and revenue from sustainable marine-related industries
- **Two Subgoals**: 
  - **Livelihoods**: Quality and quantity of jobs
    - **Focus**: Marine-related jobs
    - **Example Industries**: Commercial fishing, mariculture, tourism and recreation, whale watching, etc
  - **Economies**: Amount of revenue produced
    - **Focus**: Revenue for all coastal regions from marine-related sectors
    - **Coverage**: Both direct and indirect marine industry connections

:::

## Key Questions

Should the OHI Gulf of California **maintain** the two subgoals: Livelihoods and Economies?

#### **Livelihoods**

There is a quantity and quality aspect to this goal, typically.  **Is there anything important to analyze apart from the quantity and quality of marine jobs?**

- How (*ideally*) do we measure the **quantity and quality** of people’s marine-related jobs? 
  - How do we define the **reference point**?
  - How do we incorporate **sustainability** into the assessment?
  
#### **Economies**

What are some important marine-sector industries within the Gulf that come to mind?

- How (*ideally*) do we measure the **revenue** of these sectors? 
  - How do we define the **reference point**?
  - How do we incorporate **sustainability** into the assessment?


##### Other OHI + assessments:

Nearly all assessments include one or both of these subgoals. Typically, a high score is obtained when livelihoods and economies remain constant or improve (a temporal reference point). For livelihoods, there have been several approaches to measuring job quality.  Some assessments include industries that do not require a healthy ocean (e.g., wind energy, shipping, etc.), others have excluded these. A constant challenge is determining how to count jobs that are indirectly supported by marine industries (e.g., manufacture of fishing gear, etc.)

## Regional Considerations

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group (EWG).**

- The group discussed how to measure jobs and revenue from sustainable, marine-related industries, focusing on both the number/quality of jobs (Livelihoods) and economic output (Economies).
- Main livelihoods sectors identified: fishing, mariculture, tourism/ecotourism, recreation, and more.
- Major challenges flagged:
  - **Organized crime** in fisheries is a significant threat, affecting security, job numbers, and potentially forcing diversification.
  - **Job security** issues: Workers face risks like bribes, possible forced relocation, and lack of long-term benefits, pushing some out of fishing for more secure jobs elsewhere.
  - Debate over job quantity vs. quality: rise in fisher numbers may be positive for livelihoods but may not address poverty or job sustainability.
  - **Government subsidies** play a big role; all fishers receive payments, with notable political dynamics (e.g., vote buying).
  - Interest in adding **gender equality** as a key indicator.
  - Need to make **sustainability** an explicit sub-goal.
- For the Economies subgoal:
  - Emphasis on capturing both direct and indirect revenue from marine sectors.
  - Identified a need to map and include research institutes, universities, and NGOs operating in the region.
  - Proposed using improved data sources (e.g., business registries, household surveys) for more accurate measurement.
  - **Marine infrastructure projects** (e.g., underwater gas lines) are seen as added pressures.
- Mexico’s broader economic context was noted: there is a current recession phase, yet it has a high ranking in the World Happiness Report.
