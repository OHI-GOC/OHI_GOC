### **Meeting Summaries**


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #1:** Recap & Next Steps

**Thank you for joining our first Livelihoods & Economies Goalkeeper meeting!**  
It was a great start to our work together in defining coastal livelihoods and economies for the **Gulf of California**, and how it should be integrated into this assessment.  

::: {.callout-tip}

### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

During our discussion, the group came to the conclusion that incorporating both **Livelihoods** and **Economies** as subgoals is very important for the Gulf of California. This agreement allowed us to move into defining important **direct** and **indirect** coastal and marine-related sectors in the Gulf, as well as beginning to consider how to measure, categorize, and assess them.

The group discussed experiences from previous work in Mexico, including the use of **surveys** and **household-level data** (e.g., from INEGI and other organizations) to quantify livelihoods and employment. It was noted that the diversity of jobs in the Gulf requires considering the different contexts across the states that compose the region.

##### **_Sectors mentioned included:_**

- **Commercial fishing**
  - Artisanal fishing  
  - Subsistence fishing (the portion that is also sold, providing a livelihood)  
  - Industrial fishing (e.g., shrimp, tuna)  
  - Recreational fishing (sport fishing, such as tour operators for visitors who fish; in some locations this may be more economically important than scuba diving)  

- **Tourism/Recreation**
  - Jobs that provide activities and experiences in the Gulf  
  - Jobs and revenue produced due to people visiting the Gulf  
  - Debate on whether certain jobs, such as hotel work, should be considered under marine-related tourism, particularly when they may generate revenue but could also have negative effects on local access to resources  

- **Ecotourism**
  - e.g., tours, whale watching, scuba diving, etc.  

- **Aquaculture/Mariculture**

- **Other possible sectors**
  - Renewable/tidal energy  
  - Salt extraction (though data may be challenging to find, particularly for small-scale operations)  
  - Organized crime (noting its complex role in some coastal communities — employing individuals and generating revenue, but also deterring fishing activities)  

##### **_Sectors to discuss:_**

- Shipping and/or ships  
- Ports  

##### **_Data and measurement considerations:_**

Participants agreed to focus on identifying relevant job sectors, finding data on the **number of jobs**, their **quality**, and **revenue** associated with them. This includes considering:

- Sustainability metrics — Where is the revenue coming from, and to whom/where is it going?  
- Local vs. external investment  
- Scale of business operations (small-scale, artisanal vs. industrial)  
- Adaptive behavioral changes of fishermen as job availabilities shift due to climate change  
- Defining **job quality** — Is it the number of workers with benefits? In fisheries, how many have legal permits to fish? How many dependents are in each household?  

The group acknowledged the challenges of quantifying **small-scale operations** and the lack of contextualized data for certain sectors, and emphasized the importance of identifying these data gaps to integrate them into the ideal goal model.

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #2:** Goal Definition, Targets & Sector Scope

**Thank you to everyone who joined our second Livelihoods & Economies Goalkeeper meeting!**  
This session included discussions on what the LE goal means and which sectors it should cover.

::: {.callout-tip}

### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

All in all, we focused on three core topics:

1. **LE Goal Definition**  
   We confirmed the Gulf of California LE goal measures **jobs and revenue from marine-related industries**, split into:
   - **Livelihoods:** quantity and quality of ocean-related jobs (*ideal state → more, higher-quality jobs*).  
   - **Economies:** revenue from all coastal regions tied to marine sectors (*ideal state → equitable revenue growth*).

2. **Targets (“Ideal States”)**  
   The group reaffirmed that the goal should envision thriving, **sustainable livelihoods and economies**, not just higher numbers.

3. **Sustainability & Sector Inclusion**  
   After debate, we chose **not** to restrict the goal to “only sustainable sectors.”  
   Instead, we will:
   - Include **all major marine and Gulf-relevant sectors** (even those not fully reliant on a healthy ocean, such as **shipping/ports** or **renewable energy**).  
   - Apply a **sustainability factor** to capture ecological footprint and social equity (management quality, local hiring, etc.).  
   Rationale: omitting ports or energy would under-represent real economic activity and limit the Ocean Health Index’s **Action pillar** from targeting needed improvements. For example, if ports have strong laws but **weak management**, the GoC OHI can identify that gap and spur reforms.

---

#### Sectors to be included

- **Shipping & ports:** retained for **jobs & revenue**, while acknowledging ballast water, invasive species, and pollution as **pressures** to be handled separately.
- **Renewable/tidal energy:** not large today, but the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturale aims to move what is currently [a potential into a reality](https://www.gob.mx/semarnat/documentos/guia-de-programas-de-fomento-a-la-generacion-de-energia-con-recursos-renovables).

- **Salt extraction:** this likely fits better under **Natural Products**; final placement will depend on available datasets.
- **Research & science:**  the group agreed we should include this sector for **livelihoods** (scientist jobs, local services) and potentially **economies** if we can quantify value added through:
  - Aquariums and nature-based tourism  
  - Conservation-linked outreach or “science tourism”  
  - Regional economic activity linked to research stations
- **Other pre-established sectors from Meeting #1** (commercial fishing (industrial, artisanal, etc), tourism and recreation, ecotourism, aquaculture/mariculture) remain included.

#### Table of agreed sectors (working list)

The idea is that for each of these sectors, we will be considering its livelihoods (number of jobs, their quality) and economy (revenue from that sector).

| Sector / Industry                | Key Notes |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| **Commercial Fishing (Artisanal)** | Long-standing livelihood; culturally & economically vital; dependent on local marine resources. |
| **Commercial Fishing (Subsistence)** | Provides household food security; surplus generates modest income. |
| **Commercial Fishing (Industrial)** | Major driver for shrimp, tuna & other export species; broad market reach. |
| **Recreational / Sport Fishing**   | Significant tourism draw; tour operators generate local jobs; sometimes surpasses diving in value. |
| **Tourism / Recreation**           | Broad visitor employment & revenue (guiding, hospitality, transport); affects local resource access. |
| **Ecotourism**                     | Focused on wildlife & ecosystem experiences (whale watching, seabird tours, scuba, kayaking). |
| **Aquaculture / Mariculture**      | Expanding sector; regenerative aquaculture hubs (e.g., [La Paz](https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/mexico-launches-global-center-for-regenerative-aquaculture-at-2025-un-ocean-conference/)); stable, year-round employment potential. |
| **Shipping / Ports**               | Substantial employment & trade; requires careful management of ballast water, emissions & habitat pressures. |
| **Renewable / Tidal Energy**       | Minimal activity now; possible increase in the future. |
| **Natural Products / Salt Extraction** | Historically important, now largely artisanal; includes collagen from fish scales, sea cucumbers for medicinal uses, salt mining, etc. |
| **Research & Ocean Education**    | Science & education jobs, local service demand; resilience value via knowledge generation. |

#### OHI Core team strategy before the next meeting

The group identified **INEGI’s National Survey of Occupation and Employment (ENOE)** as the most promising starting point for quantifying both **job numbers** and **job quality** across sectors. Sophia will begin by classifying the specific occupation types available in ENOE into the sectors our group has agreed upon. She will also explore which ENOE variables can serve as indicators of **job quality** — for example, benefits, employment stability, or contract type — and start investigating potential approaches to estimate **sector revenue**. 

In the coming weeks, please share **any additional datasets** or resources that might provide insight on employment, revenue, or sustainability metrics so they can be incorporated into our shared analysis!

:::

### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> Next Steps
- [ ] Populate the [LE Goalkeeper Ideas Document](#) with **additional indicators, datasets, and thoughts on sustainability multipliers**.
- [ ] Review and comment on **sector placement** (e.g., salt, research).
- [ ] Identify any **regional data** on port certifications, management practices, or university 

We’ll reconvene for **Meeting #3 on _October 3_** to refine indicators and explore initial ENOE results.

Thank you all for helping sharpen the vision for Livelihoods & Economies in the Gulf of California!

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i>  **Meeting #3:** Revenue Data & Reference Points

**_During our group activity for the Livelihoods & Economies (LE) goal, we focused on identifying revenue data sources and possible benchmarks across marine-related sectors in the Gulf of California._**

We noted that **Livelihoods** indicators are largely covered by INEGI’s **ENOE survey**, which already provides strong coverage of employment, income, and job quality. For **Recreational Fishing** and **Ecotourism**, however, we will need creative approaches to complement ENOE.

Key points from the discussion included:

- **Industrial & Artisanal Commercial Fishing:**  
  Revenue data are available from **CONAPESCA landings records**, with possible indicators including landed value, vessel counts, and CPUE. Specific ideas include revenue per unit effort or MSY-based reference points (BMSY * price).  

- **Recreational/Sports Fishing:**  
  Limited data exist, but **sportfishing permits** (available since 2009) provide one time series. Additional sources include **port captaincy directories** (by state) and literature on tourism-based sportfishing. Revenue may be approximated using permits sold, right fees, or estimates from tourism activity in key locations such as La Paz,Los Cabos, San Felipe, Puerto Peñasco, Guaymas, and Loreto.  

- **Tourism:**  
  Possible sources include **INEGI’s PIB Turístico (tourism GDP)**, **Datatur hotel occupancy**, and Mexico’s **Non-Resident Duty (DNR)**, a federal fee collected from cruise ship passengers and land/sea tourists. There are **government reference points from Plan México**:  
  - Increase Mexico’s tourism GDP by **9%**.  
  - Increase DNR revenue collection by **40.5%**.  
  These reference points could provide useful targets for revenue indicators. 

- **Ecotourism:**  
  Most ecotourism focuses on **protected areas**, where **CONANP offices maintain entrance fee records (*cobro de derechos*)**. These fees can be requested through the Transparency Platform or directly from CONANP directors. Reference points could include maximum visitation limits or total entrance fee revenue as a proxy for activity levels.  

- **Aquaculture & Mariculture:**  
  Sources include **CONAPESCA’s aquaculture diagnostics** and state aquaculture health committees (e.g., shrimp, oysters). Because sustainability practices affect yields, profits or revenue adjusted for sustainable practices may serve as better indicators.  

- **Renewable Energy:**  
  The **National Atlas of Areas with High Clean Energy Potential** (SENER) shows high tidal/wave energy potential between Sinaloa and Baja California Sur. The OHI Core Team will continue searching for revenue data on renewable resource industries to evaluate whether these can be included in the LE framework.  

- **Natural Products & Salt:**  
  Revenue streams may include algae, fisheries residues, pearls, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, aquarium trade species, biofuels, and traditional products (e.g., totoaba, peyote, mangroves). **Salt extraction** data are available in the **Statistical Yearbook of Mexican Mining**, which reports by municipality (volume, not value). If questions arise, the group suggested we could reach out to the [**Asociación Mexicana de la Industria Salinera**](https://www.amisac.org.mx/miembros-de-amisac/) for clarification.  

- **Shipping & Ports:**  
  **Capitanías de Puerto** (under SICT) regulate vessel registries for commercial vs. recreational fleets. Every vessel must be registered with the **Secretaría de Infraestructura, Comunicaciones y Transportes (SICT)**, making this an important source for shipping/port-related revenue indicators.  

- **Research & Ocean Education:**  
  Indicators could include the number of marine researchers registered in the **National System for Researchers (SNI)** and the number of accredited science and education institutions in RENIECYT.  

Overall, the group agreed that the **next step** is to refine revenue and job indicators across these sectors and align them with feasible reference points. This will ensure that the LE goal reflects both the scale of marine-related economic activity and its sustainability in the Gulf of California.

---

**NEXT STEPS**

- Review job occupations and their related sectors/industries, [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ixhixn-pC6BPo4fwVi4sTkPXQbd7R-iKG3MF5XV4l_g/edit?tab=t.b70pl17vrhvs#heading=h.98g1rjoyl0rg)
- Review the possible job quality metrics, [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ixhixn-pC6BPo4fwVi4sTkPXQbd7R-iKG3MF5XV4l_g/edit?tab=t.1pis55i8x5m#heading=h.98g1rjoyl0rg)
- Continue searching for revenue data for renewable energy.

### Additional Insights & Examples

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Expert Working Group (EWG): Regional Considerations

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group (EWG).**

- The group discussed how to measure jobs and revenue from sustainable, marine-related industries, focusing on both the number/quality of jobs (Livelihoods) and economic output (Economies).
- Main livelihoods sectors identified: fishing, mariculture, tourism/ecotourism, recreation, and more.
- Major challenges flagged:
  - **Organized crime** in fisheries is a significant threat, affecting security, job numbers, and potentially forcing diversification.
  - **Job security** issues: Workers face risks like bribes, possible forced relocation, and lack of long-term benefits, pushing some out of fishing for more secure jobs elsewhere.
  - Debate over job quantity vs. quality: rise in fisher numbers may be positive for livelihoods but may not address poverty or job sustainability.
  - **Government subsidies** play a big role; all fishers receive payments, with notable political dynamics (e.g., vote buying).
  - Interest in adding **gender equality** as a key indicator.
  - Need to make **sustainability** an explicit sub-goal.
- For the Economies subgoal:
  - Emphasis on capturing both direct and indirect revenue from marine sectors.
  - Identified a need to map and include research institutes, universities, and NGOs operating in the region.
  - Proposed using improved data sources (e.g., business registries, household surveys) for more accurate measurement.
  - **Marine infrastructure projects** (e.g., underwater gas lines) are seen as added pressures.
- Mexico’s broader economic context was noted: there is a current recession phase, yet it has a high ranking in the World Happiness Report.

:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Notes on other OHI + assessments:

Nearly all assessments include one or both of these subgoals. 

Typically, a high score is obtained when livelihoods and economies remain constant or improve (a temporal reference point). 

For livelihoods, there have been several approaches to measuring job quality.  

Some assessments include industries that do not require a healthy ocean (e.g., wind energy, shipping, etc.), others have excluded these. 

A constant challenge is determining how to count jobs that are indirectly supported by marine industries (e.g., manufacture of fishing gear, etc.)
