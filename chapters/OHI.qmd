## Starting an OHI assessment!

Welcome! This page will help us begin planning and preparing for the OHI Gulf of California assessment!

### Phase 1: Planning the launch

This phase of the project involves:

- building awareness and support through informational webinars and meetings
- developing a consortium of people within Mexico to co-lead and network connections
- acquisition and disbursement of funding
- developing a strategic plan and timeline for the project

One of the most important steps of Phase 1 is **Establishing an expert working group!**

Along with regional experts, this group will include OHI experts and analysts from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, University of California, Santa Barbara.

[Working group participants](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1381QCMyFirxWT6vkxxmUi_o_fW5VZtGL_KsVIagMl7o/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
 For access to this Google spreadsheet, contact Melanie Frazier at frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu


### Phase 2: Developing the framework

The expert working group will have several responsibilities, including (more information provided below):

- Learning more about the OHI framework and work flow, and exploring the philosophy underlying the [OHI goals](https://oceanhealthindex.org/goals/).
- Establishing timeline
- Defining spatial boundaries
- Determining which goals/subgoals will be included in the assessment based on local characteristics and regional priorities
- Identifying pressure and resilience variables that are relevant to the region
- Identifying Goal Keepers who will develop models for each goal, identify data, and help establish reference points for each goal
- Developing relationships with key stakeholders
- Providing support during Phase 3 (score calculations), including: identifying possible data, reviewing goal methods and scores, collaborating on reference points, preparing and supporting meetings, etc. 

**Learning more**
This website will be an important information hub for the OHI Gulf of California! 

There are many general resources for learning about the Ocean Health Index, but the best place to start is the [OHI website](https://oceanhealthindex.org/). In particular, it will be useful to become familiar with each of the 10 [goals](https://oceanhealthindex.org/goals/). The website also includes useful information about embarking on a [regional OHI assessment](https://oceanhealthindex.org/ohi+/conduct/).


**Nail down timeline**
Identify key deadlines and meeting times. A tentative timeline is provided above, and the corresponding Google spreadsheet can be edited [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sVkjg_hJ6f-SXedLJ-gqXmPpEVWXcPvnY83pIH9HRCo/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (contact Melanie at frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu for access).

**Defining spatial boundaries**
Several decisions will need to be made concerning the boundaries of the assessment. This [document](https://ohi-goc.github.io/ohi_goc_prep/spatial/ohi_goc_spatial_prep.html) explains some of the issues. 

**Framework: Goals**
The goal framework will need to be established. This will involve determining whether goals should cut or added. Goal models should also be evaluated to determine how they can be improved to meet the needs of the region. It will also be necessary to consider reference points!

The best way to approach this is to explore the philosophy underlying each goal. The [OHI global website](https://oceanhealthindex.org/goals/) provides a brief description of each goal and each goal page includes a link to **PRACTICAL GUIDANCE** which provides specific advice and a description of how other regional indices have adapted the goal to fit their needs. 

It is also worth navigating the menu bar to your left to learn about the goals. These will be updated over time to be more specific to the Gulf of California.

**Framework: Pressures and Resilience**
The pressures and resilience metrics will also need to be established. We will provide more guidance on that later, but in the meantime, you can learn more about [pressure](https://oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/pressure/) and [resilience](https://oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/resilience/) metrics. 

**Identify Goal Keepers**
After the goals are established, it will be necessary to identify 3-5 subject matter experts to work on each goal. These "Goalies" will help develop goal models, identify potential data, and establish reference points. 

They will work closely with the Expert Working Group to develop and test the goals.

### Phase 3: Score calculation
More to come!!!
