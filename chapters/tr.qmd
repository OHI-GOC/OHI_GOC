**This goal captures the quantity and quality of experiences that people have when visiting coastal and marine areas.**

::: {.custom-box}

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

- *Focus:* Value that people derive from experiencing and enjoying coastal areas  
- *Not about:* Revenue or livelihoods generated by tourism (covered under Livelihoods and Economies)  
- *Emphasis:* Personal and cultural value of coastal recreation experiences

:::

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **tourism and recreation** goal? 

- How (*ideally*) do we measure the **quantity and quality of people’s experience** from visiting coastal areas? Should certain experiences be prioritized?
- How do we define the **reference point**?
- How do we incorporate **sustainability** into the assessment?

## Examples of reference points from other OHI assessments

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

| Reference Point Type        | Example |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Government-defined objectives | Increase tourism by 20% by 2050 |
| Local preferences +         | Desire for quiet vs. busy beaches |
| Carrying capacity           | Maximize tourism relative to [carrying capacity](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/10/3938) |
| Stable tourism levels       | No net losses or gains in tourism over time |
| Tourist density comparisons | Compare tourists/km² with other regions |

<small>+ Often a policy tension: governments promote tourism for jobs, while communities experience social and environmental impacts</small>

## Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

**Tourism Types Mentioned:**

- **Massive Tourism:**  
  Large-scale government-promoted developments  
- **Community Tourism:**  
  Includes efforts like:
  - Resilience MPAs with island communities  
  - CONAP collaboration  
  - Guaymas community-led initiatives  
- **Ecotourism:**  
  Even NGO-led efforts can cause unintended harm  

**Key Issues Identified:**

- **Government Promotion:** Strong push for large-scale tourism throughout the Gulf  
- **Environmental Regulation:** Weak regulation, especially around beach development  
- **Community Impact:**  
  - Need to balance economic benefits (e.g., jobs) with environmental and social costs  
  - Highlight alternatives to mass tourism  

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Job Creation vs. Social Costs**  
- **Local vs. External Benefits**  
- **Cultural Impact**  
- **Organized Crime**  
- **Social Stability** (e.g., drug-related problems, institutional breakdown)
