# <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>  About the TR Goal

**This goal captures the quantity and quality of experiences that people have when visiting coastal and marine areas.**

::: {.custom-box}

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

- **_Focus:_** Value that people derive from experiencing and enjoying coastal areas  
- **_Not about:_** Revenue or livelihoods generated by tourism (covered under Livelihoods and Economies)  
- **_Emphasis:_** Personal and cultural value of coastal recreation experiences

:::

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **tourism and recreation** goal? 

- How (*ideally*) do we measure the **quantity and quality of people’s experience** from visiting coastal areas? Should certain experiences be prioritized?
- How do we define the **reference point**?
- How do we incorporate **sustainability** into the assessment?

### **Meeting Summaries**


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #1:** Recap & Next Steps

**Thank you to everyone who joined our first Tourism & Recreation (TR) Goalkeeper meeting!**  
It was a great start to our work together in defining what sustainable tourism and recreation means for the **Gulf of California**.  

::: {.callout-tip}

#### **Meeting Recap**

During our discussion, we identified **three main types of tourism** in the region:  

- **Massive Tourism** – Often centered around “sun and beach” resorts, leisure activities, and nightlife.  
- **Ecotourism** – Structured under formal government categories, this includes nature and conservation-focused tourism.  
- **Local Tourism & Recreation** – Activities led by or for the local community and residents.  

We also highlighted **Nautical Tourism** — water-based experiences like sailing and marine tours, often taking place entirely at sea. This type could either be its **own category** or be considered a **subset** of the three main types above. This remains an open question we're still exploring.

In addition, we discussed **tourism origins**:

- **International**
- **Domestic**
- **Local**

And brainstormed potential measures for:  

- **Quantity**: such as number of hotels, flights, sailboats, and visits
- **Quality**: such as user sentiment from TripAdvisor reviews or surveys (e.g., QR surveys at beach entrances — although these are beyond our current project scope).

##### 🌱 What Does “Sustainability” Mean for TR?

We agreed that **sustainability** in tourism should reflect:

- **Positive social impact** – like preserving local culture and community benefits  
- **Positive environmental impact** – including proper management of protected areas and potential use of mechanisms like conservation bracelets or differentiated tariffs for locals vs. nationals

#### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Next Steps**

- Review the [TR introduction slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14jGvm4OQk5iQ8YPZknfYBqDwHC0SU6ElYwz0OoRrvlo/edit?usp=sharing) to revisit the main ideas.  
- Review the [Key Questions](#key-questions) in the "About the TR Goal" tab, and keep brainstorming.  
- Add your thoughts, ideas, and potential data sources to the ongoing [collaborative document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZtgUCeaz3Rx2r93bPzRdEeiBQDZv8U6cH1i12CnIcAI/edit?tab=t.0).  

In our **next meeting**, we’ll continue discussing how to evaluate:

1. **Quantity**
2. **Quality**
3. **Sustainability** of tourism and recreation in the Gulf of California.

We'll also start to define the **reference point** for this goal — our vision of what ideal, sustainable tourism and recreation looks like. In assessment terms, this is the **"100" score** — our A+ target!

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #2:** Recap & Next Steps

Below are some key themes and insights from this month’s Tourism & Recreation discussion. Even though participation was limited, the conversation provided valuable context, examples, and new ideas for refining our goals and indicators.  

1. **What makes “healthy” tourism?**  
We explored whether growth in international visitors is automatically beneficial for local communities. While tourism brings jobs, there are trade-offs in terms of real estate pressures and lifestyle changes. The group emphasized that growth is positive only if:
   - local communities benefit,  
   - ecosystems remain healthy, and  
   - use stays within the region’s carrying capacity (TCC).

2. **Real estate and access**  
Tourism-related real estate development strongly affects both community well being and coastal access. In the Gulf of California, beach access is often restricted by resorts or private properties, despite Mexican law requiring public access points. Tracking property patterns and access roads may help us create stronger indicators.

3. **Types of tourism**  
We distinguished between different tourism forms:
   - **International & domestic:** Resorts, nautical tourism (boating/yachting), and most ecotourism.  
   - **Local:** More tied to everyday activities (restaurants, malecón visits).  
Nautical tourism in particular is likely limited to wealthier visitors, given costs and leisure constraints.  

   _See draft tourism types matrix below:_  
   ![](figs/quantity_tr_meeting2.png)

4. **Socioeconomic impacts**  
High quality jobs in tourism (ex: guides, operators, business owners) often go to outsiders rather than local residents. While progress *is* being made, with more young locals entering the sector, it remains a key area to monitor to ensure benefits are equitably shared.

5. **Carrying Capacity & Sustainability**  
Resource use, particularly water and energy, highlights the inequities between resorts and local households. Assessing sustainability will require balancing visitor numbers with fair allocation of essential resources.

6. **Indicator framework possibility:**  
The group suggested structuring indicators into three subcomponents:  
   - **Quantity** (number of visitors, tourism types)  
   - **Quality** (job opportunities, local benefits)  
   - **Sustainability** (resource use, ecological impacts, cultural impacts)  

We also noted that some certifications (like Blue Flag beaches) may apply primarily to high traffic tourism areas, which could affect how sustainability indicators are framed.

### Next Steps

We will be discussing the indicator framework (Quantity, Quality, Sustainability), as well as ideal indicators to reflect the intent of this goal.  Please come prepared to discuss indicators for each type of tourism's quantity, quality, and sustainability.

Thank you, and stay tuned for a meeting agenda for Meeting #3!

### Additional Insights & Examples

# Expert Working Group (EWG): Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

**Tourism Types Mentioned:**

- **Massive Tourism:**  
  Large-scale government-promoted developments  
- **Community Tourism:**  
  Includes efforts like:
  - Resilience MPAs with island communities  
  - CONAP collaboration  
  - Guaymas community-led initiatives  
- **Ecotourism:**  
  Even NGO-led efforts can cause unintended harm  

**Key Issues Identified:**

- **Government Promotion:** Strong push for large-scale tourism throughout the Gulf  
- **Environmental Regulation:** Weak regulation, especially around beach development  
- **Community Impact:**  
  - Need to balance economic benefits (e.g., jobs) with environmental and social costs  
  - Highlight alternatives to mass tourism  

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Job Creation vs. Social Costs**  
- **Local vs. External Benefits**  
- **Cultural Impact**  
- **Organized Crime**  
- **Social Stability** (e.g., drug-related problems, institutional breakdown)

# Examples of reference points from other OHI assessments

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

| Reference Point Type        | Example |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Government-defined objectives | Increase tourism by 20% by 2050 |
| Local preferences +         | Desire for quiet vs. busy beaches |
| Carrying capacity           | Maximize tourism relative to [carrying capacity](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/10/3938) |
| Stable tourism levels       | No net losses or gains in tourism over time |
| Tourist density comparisons | Compare tourists/km² with other regions |

<small>+ Often a policy tension: governments promote tourism for jobs, while communities experience social and environmental impacts</small>
