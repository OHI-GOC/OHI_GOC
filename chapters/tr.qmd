# <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>  About the TR Goal

**This goal captures the quantity and quality of experiences that people have when visiting coastal and marine areas.**

::: {.custom-box}

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

- **_Focus:_** Value that people derive from experiencing and enjoying coastal areas  
- **_Not about:_** Revenue or livelihoods generated by tourism (covered under Livelihoods and Economies)  
- **_Emphasis:_** Personal and cultural value of coastal recreation experiences

:::

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **tourism and recreation** goal? 

- How (*ideally*) do we measure the **quantity and quality of people‚Äôs experience** from visiting coastal areas? Should certain experiences be prioritized?
- How do we define the **reference point**?
- How do we incorporate **sustainability** into the assessment?

### **Meeting Summaries**


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #1:** Introduction to TR

**Thank you to everyone who joined our first Tourism & Recreation (TR) Goalkeeper meeting!**  
It was a great start to our work together in defining what sustainable tourism and recreation means for the **Gulf of California**.  

::: {.callout-tip}

#### **Meeting Recap**

During our discussion, we identified **three main types of tourism** in the region:  

- **Massive Tourism** ‚Äì Often centered around ‚Äúsun and beach‚Äù resorts, leisure activities, and nightlife.  
- **Ecotourism** ‚Äì Structured under formal government categories, this includes nature and conservation-focused tourism.  
- **Local Tourism & Recreation** ‚Äì Activities led by or for the local community and residents.  

We also highlighted **Nautical Tourism** ‚Äî water-based experiences like sailing and marine tours, often taking place entirely at sea. This type could either be its **own category** or be considered a **subset** of the three main types above. This remains an open question we're still exploring.

In addition, we discussed **tourism origins**:

- **International**
- **Domestic**
- **Local**

And brainstormed potential measures for:  

- **Quantity**: such as number of hotels, flights, sailboats, and visits
- **Quality**: such as user sentiment from TripAdvisor reviews or surveys (e.g., QR surveys at beach entrances ‚Äî although these are beyond our current project scope).

##### üå± What Does ‚ÄúSustainability‚Äù Mean for TR?

We agreed that **sustainability** in tourism should reflect:

- **Positive social impact** ‚Äì like preserving local culture and community benefits  
- **Positive environmental impact** ‚Äì including proper management of protected areas and potential use of mechanisms like conservation bracelets or differentiated tariffs for locals vs. nationals  
:::

::: {.callout-important}
#### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Next Steps**

- Review the [TR introduction slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14jGvm4OQk5iQ8YPZknfYBqDwHC0SU6ElYwz0OoRrvlo/edit?usp=sharing) to revisit the main ideas.  
- Review the [Key Questions](#key-questions) in the "About the TR Goal" tab, and keep brainstorming.  
- Add your thoughts, ideas, and potential data sources to the ongoing [collaborative document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZtgUCeaz3Rx2r93bPzRdEeiBQDZv8U6cH1i12CnIcAI/edit?tab=t.0).  

In our **next meeting**, we‚Äôll continue discussing how to evaluate:

1. **Quantity**
2. **Quality**
3. **Sustainability** of tourism and recreation in the Gulf of California.

We'll also start to define the **reference point** for this goal ‚Äî our vision of what ideal, sustainable tourism and recreation looks like. In assessment terms, this is the **"100" score** ‚Äî our A+ target!

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #2:** Ideal states

Below are some key themes and insights from this month‚Äôs Tourism & Recreation discussion. Even though participation was limited, the conversation provided valuable context, examples, and new ideas for refining our goals and indicators.  

1. **What makes ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù tourism?**  
We explored whether growth in international visitors is automatically beneficial for local communities. While tourism brings jobs, there are trade-offs in terms of real estate pressures and lifestyle changes. The group emphasized that growth is positive only if:
   - local communities benefit,  
   - ecosystems remain healthy, and  
   - use stays within the region‚Äôs carrying capacity (TCC).

2. **Real estate and access**  
Tourism-related real estate development strongly affects both community well being and coastal access. In the Gulf of California, beach access is often restricted by resorts or private properties, despite Mexican law requiring public access points. Tracking property patterns and access roads may help us create stronger indicators.

3. **Types of tourism**  
We distinguished between different tourism forms:
   - **International & domestic:** Resorts, nautical tourism (boating/yachting), and most ecotourism.  
   - **Local:** More tied to everyday activities (restaurants, malec√≥n visits).  
Nautical tourism in particular is likely limited to wealthier visitors, given costs and leisure constraints.  

   _See draft tourism types matrix below:_  
   ![](figs/quantity_tr_meeting2.png)

4. **Socioeconomic impacts**  
High quality jobs in tourism (ex: guides, operators, business owners) often go to outsiders rather than local residents. While progress *is* being made, with more young locals entering the sector, it remains a key area to monitor to ensure benefits are equitably shared.

5. **Carrying Capacity & Sustainability**  
Resource use, particularly water and energy, highlights the inequities between resorts and local households. Assessing sustainability will require balancing visitor numbers with fair allocation of essential resources.

6. **Indicator framework possibility:**  
The group suggested structuring indicators into three subcomponents:  
   - **Quantity** (number of visitors, tourism types)  
   - **Quality** (job opportunities, local benefits)  
   - **Sustainability** (resource use, ecological impacts, cultural impacts)  

We also noted that some certifications (like Blue Flag beaches) may apply primarily to high traffic tourism areas, which could affect how sustainability indicators are framed.

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #3:** Indicators & Data Sources

Thank you all for coming to the third Tourism & Recreation Goalkeeper meeting!  

During this meeting, we worked together to identify indicators and their possible data sources for the three components of **TR: Quantity, Quality, and Sustainability.**

---

The TR goal *‚Äúcaptures the quantity, quality, and sustainability of experiences that people have when visiting coastal and marine areas.‚Äù*  

As a group, we discussed possible data sources and technical benchmarks for each TR indicator.  

Below is a synthesis of our meeting discussion and the Activity we participated in as a group, located in the TR Goalkeeper Ideas document under the tab:  

<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>[**Meeting #3 Activity**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZtgUCeaz3Rx2r93bPzRdEeiBQDZv8U6cH1i12CnIcAI/edit?tab=t.m4jmmgpcanvc)

---

::: {.custom-box}

### **Quantity**

The most consistent and accessible sources across OHI regions are:  

- **Programa de Monitoreo de la Actividad Hotelera**  
- **DataTur from SECTUR** (tourist arrivals and overnights)  
- **SEMAR** data on cruise ship arrivals and passenger volumes  

We also discussed localized sources such as:

- Marina associations for occupancy of boats (ex: San Carlos Marina)  
- Port authorities (# of vessels that have permits for tourism & recreation, obtained via transparency requests)  
- **CONANP** cobro de derechos visitor fees (as proxies for visitation of coastal protected areas)  

Ecotourism proves harder to quantify, but potential indicators include:  

- The number of ecotourism companies ([**INEGI** registry of economic units](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/descarga/?ti=6))
- INEGI occupations in ecotourism as a proxy for amount of ecotourists (**INEGI ENOE**)
- Number of marine ecotourists, SCUBA diving sites (Published research, e.g., Favoretto and Schuhbauer)  

---

### **Quality**

We identified both infrastructure- and perception-based indicators:  

- Rate of return, better than length of stay (state tourism visitor satisfaction surveys)  
- Density of services/activities near coast (**INEGI DENUE data**)  
- Social perceptions of security (**Mexican Peace Index**)  

---

### **Sustainability**

We distinguished between environmental and social aspects.  

Potential **Environmental sustainability** indicators:  

- Relative weight of ecotourism vs. mass tourism  (expanding ecotourism opportunities, assuming that when ecotourism is done right, it is the gold standard for tourism practices)
- Stewardship measures (such as Blue Flag beach distinctions)  
- Land-system change (conservation priority areas converted to resorts ‚Üí accessing data requires transparency requests)  

Potential aspects of **Social sustainability**:  

- Quality of local tourism jobs (**INEGI ENOE data** to assess job quality, such as benefits, salary)
- Tourism benefits should be within communities (need indicators for this)
- Gender equality in tourism employment opportunities
  

---

:::

<br>

While strong datasets exist for basic visitor numbers, more creative combinations of proxies, state-level surveys, transparency requests, and international research will be needed to capture the full TR goal.  _The challenge is to balance availability and rigor while avoiding overly normative assumptions, especially when it comes to visitor **quality.**_

**This is a great start for the OHI Core Team to continue exploring these indicators and their potential data sources!**


---

::: {.callout-important}
### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> Next Steps 

We will be identifying reference points for indicators within **Quantity, Quality, and Sustainability.**  

An example of the discussions we will have:  

- If the indicator for tourism quantity is **‚Äúnumber of tourist arrivals‚Äù**, should the reference point reflect *Plan M√©xico‚Äôs* goal to increase international tourism by 40% by 2030?  
  - [These are some targets for 2030 for Plan M√©xico:](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/el-objetivo-para-turismo-en-el-plan-mexico-es-ser-el-5to-pais-mas-visitado-del-mundo-para-el-2030-presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum?idiom=en)
    - The economic impact of international tourists increased by 46 percent.
    - Hotel rooms by 12 percent.
    - Tourism employment generation by 27 percent.
    - Of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tourism by 9 percent.
    - Of domestic tourism, 9.8 percent.
    - The number of service providers certified in sustainability increased by 31.5 percent.
    - Average spending per international tourist by 3.3 percent.
    - The arrival of international visitors by 30 percent.
    - The DNR's revenue collection increased by 40.5 percent.

<br>

- Or should the number of tourists be relative to the local population in the area (tourist_arrivals : locals_residing_in_tourist_centers)?  
  - In that case, the reference point could be:  
    - **Historical** (e.g., the 2019 proportion between tourists and locals, with the goal of keeping it stable), or  
    - **Theoretical/Expert-based** (what you, as experts, deem ideal for the GoCA).  

---

**Please come prepared to discuss these types of questions for:**

- Quantity  
- Quality  
- Environmental sustainability  
- Social sustainability  

_**Thank you, and stay tuned for the Meeting #4 agenda!**_

| Reference Point Type        | Example |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Government-defined objectives | Increase tourism by 20% by 2050 |
| Local preferences +         | Desire for quiet vs. busy beaches |
| Carrying capacity           | Maximize tourism relative to [carrying capacity](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/10/3938) |
| Stable tourism levels       | No net losses or gains in tourism over time |
| Tourist density comparisons | Compare tourists/km¬≤ with other regions |

<small>+ Often a policy tension: governments promote tourism for jobs, while communities experience social and environmental impacts</small>
