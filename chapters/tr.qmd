## **Meeting #1 Recap & Next Steps**

**Thank you to everyone who joined our first Tourism & Recreation (TR) Goalkeeper meeting!**  
It was a great start to our work together in defining what sustainable tourism and recreation means for the **Gulf of California**.  

::: {.callout-tip}

#### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

During our discussion, we identified **three main types of tourism** in the region:  

- **Massive Tourism** ‚Äì Often centered around ‚Äúsun and beach‚Äù resorts, leisure activities, and nightlife.  
- **Ecotourism** ‚Äì Structured under formal government categories, this includes nature and conservation-focused tourism.  
- **Local Tourism & Recreation** ‚Äì Activities led by or for the local community and residents.  

We also highlighted **Nautical Tourism** ‚Äî water-based experiences like sailing and marine tours, often taking place entirely at sea. This type could either be its **own category** or be considered a **subset** of the three main types above. This remains an open question we're still exploring.

In addition, we discussed **tourism origins**:

- **International**
- **Domestic**
- **Local**

And brainstormed potential measures for:  

- **Quantity**: such as number of hotels, flights, sailboats, and visits
- **Quality**: such as user sentiment from TripAdvisor reviews or surveys (e.g., QR surveys at beach entrances ‚Äî although these are beyond our current project scope).

##### üå± What Does ‚ÄúSustainability‚Äù Mean for TR?

We agreed that **sustainability** in tourism should reflect:

- **Positive social impact** ‚Äì like preserving local culture and community benefits  
- **Positive environmental impact** ‚Äì including proper management of protected areas and potential use of mechanisms like conservation bracelets or differentiated tariffs for locals vs. nationals

#### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Next Steps**

- Review the [TR introduction slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14jGvm4OQk5iQ8YPZknfYBqDwHC0SU6ElYwz0OoRrvlo/edit?usp=sharing) to revisit the main ideas.  
- Review the [Key Questions](#key-questions) and start brainstorming.  
- Add your thoughts, ideas, and potential data sources to the ongoing [collaborative document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZtgUCeaz3Rx2r93bPzRdEeiBQDZv8U6cH1i12CnIcAI/edit?tab=t.0).  

In our **next meeting**, we‚Äôll continue discussing how to evaluate:

1. **Quantity**
2. **Quality**
3. **Sustainability** of tourism and recreation in the Gulf of California.

We'll also start to define the **reference point** for this goal ‚Äî our vision of what ideal, sustainable tourism and recreation looks like. In assessment terms, this is the **"100" score** ‚Äî our A+ target!
:::

<br>

## Key Questions {#key-questions}

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **tourism and recreation** goal? 

- How (*ideally*) do we measure the **quantity and quality of people‚Äôs experience** from visiting coastal areas? Should certain experiences be prioritized?
- How do we define the **reference point**?
- How do we incorporate **sustainability** into the assessment?

<br>

## Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

**Tourism Types Mentioned:**

- **Massive Tourism:**  
  Large-scale government-promoted developments  
- **Community Tourism:**  
  Includes efforts like:
  - Resilience MPAs with island communities  
  - CONAP collaboration  
  - Guaymas community-led initiatives  
- **Ecotourism:**  
  Even NGO-led efforts can cause unintended harm  

**Key Issues Identified:**

- **Government Promotion:** Strong push for large-scale tourism throughout the Gulf  
- **Environmental Regulation:** Weak regulation, especially around beach development  
- **Community Impact:**  
  - Need to balance economic benefits (e.g., jobs) with environmental and social costs  
  - Highlight alternatives to mass tourism  

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Job Creation vs. Social Costs**  
- **Local vs. External Benefits**  
- **Cultural Impact**  
- **Organized Crime**  
- **Social Stability** (e.g., drug-related problems, institutional breakdown)

## Examples of reference points from other OHI assessments

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

| Reference Point Type        | Example |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Government-defined objectives | Increase tourism by 20% by 2050 |
| Local preferences +         | Desire for quiet vs. busy beaches |
| Carrying capacity           | Maximize tourism relative to [carrying capacity](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/10/3938) |
| Stable tourism levels       | No net losses or gains in tourism over time |
| Tourist density comparisons | Compare tourists/km¬≤ with other regions |

<small>+ Often a policy tension: governments promote tourism for jobs, while communities experience social and environmental impacts</small>
