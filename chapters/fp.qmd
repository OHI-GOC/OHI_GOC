# **Working Definition** for the FP Goal
The objective of the FP goal is to quantify the amount of seafood that is sustainably produced by wild-catch fisheries and mariculture operations in the region, with some reference to the proportion that stays in Mexico and supports the nutritional / protein demands of local communities.

*This definition was defined by the Goalkeeper Group during Meeting #2 but is not finalized.  See the Meeting #2 tab below for more details.*

# **About** the FP Goal

Typically, this goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught or farmed marine foods.

::: {.custom-box}
{{< fa lightbulb >}} **GOAL FOCUS**

-   Measures the amount of seafood that is sustainably harvested within the GoC for human consumption or export.
-   Aims to maximize sustainable seafood production.
-   Typically split into two subgoals: wild-caught fisheries (including artisanal, commercial, and recreational fisheries) and mariculture. But this can be altered.
:::

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **Food Provisioning** goal?

### Fisheries Subgoal
- The reference point is (typically) that all stocks in the region are sustainably managed, but how can we determine whether stocks are being sustainably managed? For the global assessment we use formal stock assessments (i.e., B/Bmsy).
- How do we weight the stocks (i.e., do all stocks count the same, should we weight by abundance)
- Should there be any penalties for underharvesting?

### Mariculture Subgoal
- How can we determine the sustainability of mariculture practices?
- What reference point should be used?

## **FP Meeting #1: Summary** - Resources & Next Steps
**Meeting #1** introduced participants and their research backgrounds related to the Gulf of California, with Erica facilitating and providing an overview of the Ocean Health Index. The group discussed the index's methodology and application to the Gulf of California region, including its assessment of various ocean health goals. The conversation ended with a discussion on the food provisioning goal, including how to define and measure sustainable food production from fisheries and mariculture in the Gulf of California. Participants were encouraged to prepare specific ideas for the next meeting.

## **FP Meeting #2 Summary** - Resources & Next Steps
In **Meeting #2** Erica, Sophia, and Andrés discussed the Ocean Health Index project's Food Provisioning goal, exploring definitions that incorporate sustainability, nutritional security, and food sovereignty considerations. They debated whether to measure food sovereignty as part of Food Provisioning or as a separate score. Ultimately, they decided that it is probably best to focus the Food Provisioning Goal on sustainably caught or farmed seafood that supports local nutritional needs (e.g., demand for protein) while potentially addressing the important cultural value of food sovereignty as a sub-goal under the "Sense of Belonging" Goal. The group also discussed challenges in conducting fishery stock assessments at the regional level in Mexico and planned to consult government scientists about available data sources beyond CONAPESCA.

**Homework for FP Meeting #3:** Think about what indicators (variables) we should include in our model to estimate regional scores for Food Provisioning. Come prepared to discuss indicators and relevant data sources beyond CONAPESCA data. If we use CONAPESCA data, what stocks do you think will be problematic or most difficult to asses?

# Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## **EWG Meeting #1** - Regional Considerations for the FP Goal

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

### Contaminant pressures (mercury and selenium):

- Mercury (Hg) accumulation in fish is a significant pressure affecting seafood sustainability and human health (although Selenium may also be relevant as a counteracting element).
- Human health data related to mercury exposure could serve as a useful proxy indicator of seafood safety and environmental pressure.

### Local Community Access and Benefits:

- May want to consider where fish are caught geographically and what percentage of the catch benefits local communities versus export or external markets.
  - This helps assess food security and equitable distribution of seafood resources.

### Environmental Impacts:

- Fish waste discharged back into the ocean is a notable environmental concern, potentially impacting ecosystem health.
