# **Working Definition** for the FP Goal
The objective of the FP goal is to quantify the amount of seafood that is sustainably produced by wild-catch fisheries and mariculture operations in the region (with some reference to the proportion that stays in Mexico and supports the nutritional / protein demands of local communities).

*This is a working definition, defined by the Goalkeeper Group during Meeting #2 and solidified during Meeting #3. See the Meeting #2 and Meeting #3 tabs below for more details.*

# **About** the FP Goal

Typically, this goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught or farmed marine foods.

::: {.custom-box}
{{< fa lightbulb >}} **GOAL FOCUS**

-   Measures the amount of seafood that is sustainably harvested within the GoC for human consumption or export.
-   Aims to maximize sustainable seafood production.
-   Typically split into two subgoals: wild-caught fisheries (including artisanal, commercial, and recreational fisheries) and mariculture. But this can be altered.
:::

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **Food Provisioning** goal?

### Fisheries Subgoal
- The reference point is (typically) that all stocks in the region are sustainably managed, but how can we determine whether stocks are being sustainably managed? For the global assessment we use formal stock assessments (i.e., B/Bmsy).
- How do we weight the stocks (i.e., do all stocks count the same, should we weight by abundance)
- Should there be any penalties for underharvesting?

### Mariculture Subgoal
- How can we determine the sustainability of mariculture practices?
- What reference point should be used?

## **FP Meeting #1: Summary** - July 22
**Meeting #1** introduced participants and their research backgrounds related to the Gulf of California, with Erica facilitating and providing an overview of the Ocean Health Index. The group discussed the index's methodology and application to the Gulf of California region, including its assessment of various ocean health goals. The conversation ended with a discussion on the food provisioning goal, including how to define and measure sustainable food production from fisheries and mariculture in the Gulf of California. Participants were encouraged to prepare specific ideas for the next meeting.

## **FP Meeting #2: Summary** - August 19
In **Meeting #2** Erica, Sophia, and Andrés discussed the Ocean Health Index project's Food Provisioning goal, exploring definitions that incorporate sustainability, nutritional security, and food sovereignty considerations. They debated whether to measure food sovereignty as part of Food Provisioning or as a separate score. Ultimately, they decided that it is probably best to focus the Food Provisioning Goal on sustainably caught or farmed seafood that supports local nutritional needs (e.g., demand for protein) while potentially addressing the important cultural value of food sovereignty as a sub-goal under the "Sense of Belonging" Goal. The group also discussed challenges in conducting fishery stock assessments at the regional level in Mexico and planned to consult government scientists about available data sources beyond CONAPESCA.

**Homework for FP Meeting #3:** Think about what indicators (variables) we should include in our model to estimate regional scores for Food Provisioning. Come prepared to discuss indicators and relevant data sources beyond CONAPESCA data. If we use CONAPESCA data, what stocks do you think will be problematic or most difficult to asses?

## **FP Meeting #3: Summary** - September 23
**In Meeting #3**, the group agreed on the working definition for the Food Provisioning Goal (discussed in previous meeting) and discussed model indicators. Discussions centered around data sources beyond CONAPESCA. The team explored various methods for evaluating fishery stocks and sustainability in the absence of traditional assessment data, including the use of expert opinions, catch per unit effort, and vessel monitoring data. They also discussed challenges in mariculture development and the need for technical reference points for this subgoal specifically.

: review the group activity shared during the meeting, wherein participants were asked to help identify potential indicators and data sources.

**Plan for FP Meeting #4:** Erica will come with a preliminary FP model for the group to critique and will present some of the data that's available through CONAPESCA. We will continue our discussion of FP indicators, data sources, and technical reference points. (In particular, I think it would be helpful to discuss technical reference points for the Mariculture subgoal.) Think of the technical reference point as the "baseline" – the closer or further away we are from the baseline according to indicator X, the higher or lower the FP score will be. That said, if an indicator does not have a technical reference point associated with it, it will be difficult if not impossible for us to parameterize it within the goal model. **Please come prepared to share your perspective on these topics.**

## **FP Meeting #4: Summary** - November 18 
**Meeting 4** focused primarily on reviewing outputs from the CONAPESCA database and discussing the proposed method for scoring the Fisheries (FIS) sub-goal. **The plan is to begin by estimating either the stock status, annual landings, or the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the most important fishery taxa using CONAPESCA landings data relative to a 5 or 10-year baseline.** When possible, stock status will be estimated using data-poor assessment methods to calculate B/BMSY. When this is not feasible—either due to insufficient data or unreliable estimates—we will instead develop a broader measure of fisheries productivity or CPUE, comparing it to the catch recommendations in the Carta Nacional Pesquera. 

**In the new year, Erica will present preliminary FIS sub-goal scores for each OHI region.**
Please keep and eye on your inbox between now and January for details regarding our next meeting!

# Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## **EWG Meeting #1** - Regional Considerations for the FP Goal

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

### Contaminant pressures (mercury and selenium):

- Mercury (Hg) accumulation in fish is a significant pressure affecting seafood sustainability and human health (although Selenium may also be relevant as a counteracting element).
- Human health data related to mercury exposure could serve as a useful proxy indicator of seafood safety and environmental pressure.

### Local Community Access and Benefits:

- May want to consider where fish are caught geographically and what percentage of the catch benefits local communities versus export or external markets.
  - This helps assess food security and equitable distribution of seafood resources.

### Environmental Impacts:

- Fish waste discharged back into the ocean is a notable environmental concern, potentially impacting ecosystem health.
