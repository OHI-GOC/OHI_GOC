# **Getting Started**

**Typically, this goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught or farmed marine foods.**

::: {.custom-box}
{{< fa lightbulb >}} **GOAL FOCUS**

-   Measures the amount of seafood that is sustainably harvested within the GoC for human consumption or export.
-   Aims to maximize sustainable seafood production.
-   Typically split into two subgoals: wild-caught fisheries (including artisanal, commercial, and recreational fisheries) and mariculture. But this can be altered.
    
:::

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **artisanal opportunities**
goal?

### Fisheries Subgoal
- The reference point is (typically) that all stocks in the region are sustainably managed, but how can we determine whether stocks are being sustainably managed? For the global assessment we use formal stock assessments (i.e., B/Bmsy).
- How do we weight the stocks (i.e., do all stocks count the same, should we weight by abundance)
- Should there be any penalties for underharvesting?


### Mariculture Subgoal
- How can we determine the sustainability of mariculture practices?
- What reference point should be used?

## FP Goalkeeper Meeting #1: Summary
**Meeting #1** introduced participants and their research backgrounds related to the Gulf of California, with Erica facilitating and providing an overview of the Ocean Health Index. The group discussed the index's methodology and application to the Gulf of California region, including its assessment of various ocean health goals. The conversation ended with a discussion on the food provisioning goal, including how to define and measure sustainable food production from fisheries and mariculture in the Gulf of California. Participants were encouraged to prepare specific ideas for the next meeting.

**In Meeting #2**, we will discuss how we might measure access to 'food provisioning' in the Gulf, and possible FP reference points, so please come prepared for this discussion. A reference point is defined as the ideal state of artisanal opportunities in the GoC.

The presentation slides and notes from meeting #1 can be accessed in the group's google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1W0_ki39XNR1zHN4tBo_tQ-wnVia4grP8).

# **Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings**

## EWG Meeting #1: Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

### Contaminant pressures (mercury and selenium):

- Mercury (Hg) accumulation in fish is a significant pressure affecting seafood sustainability and human health (although Selenium may also be relevant as a counteracting element).
- Human health data related to mercury exposure could serve as a useful proxy indicator of seafood safety and environmental pressure.

### Local Community Access and Benefits:

- May want to consider where fish are caught geographically and what percentage of the catch benefits local communities versus export or external markets.
  - This helps assess food security and equitable distribution of seafood resources.

### Environmental Impacts:

- Fish waste discharged back into the ocean is a notable environmental concern, potentially impacting ecosystem health.
