# <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i> About the SS Goal

**This goal captures the sense that marine resources are not limited by safety concerns.**

::: {.custom-box}

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

- **_Focus:_** The objective and subjective measures of safety and security in coastal and marine areas  
- **_Not about:_** Safety as a standalone goal ‚Äî rather, it is conceptualized as a pressure influencing multiple goals  
- **_Emphasis:_** Crime rates, perceptions of safety, and their impacts on other goals

:::

## Key Questions 

As we explore the idea of incorporating **Safety & Security** into the OHI for the Gulf of California, it is important to clarify the *objective, the core definitions, potential structure, and measurement considerations* for this potential goal. Below are key discussion points and considerations to review.

### 1. Objective

Does the safety and security goal seem to be more of **a pressure on many other goals**, or a goal by itself?

**_To clarify intent:_**

- What do we want to achieve by adding Safety & Security to the OHI GoCA?
  - Increase visibility of safety issues in coastal/marine areas?
  - Drive new initiatives to reduce crime and promote safer environments?
    - Does a *safer* Gulf mean a *healthier* Gulf?
  
**_To clarify definitions:_**

- Does a *"healthy gulf"* mean people are objectively safe, feel safe, or both?
- Should the goal focus on actual crime rates, perceived safety, or a combination? Or something else entirely?

| Term      | Possible Definition                                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Safety    | Objective condition with low crime/incidence of threats           |
| Security  | Subjective perception; trust in law enforcement, institutions     |

### 2. Scope 

- Should "Safety" include only organized crime, or also theft, assault, kidnapping, etc.?
- Is the ideal scenario truly zero crime, or a "tolerable" minimum?
- How do we address the diversity of crimes and their impacts on coastal communities?

### 3. Measuring

#### Safety (Objective)

- Should it potentially include:
  - Official crime statistics (coastal, marine, port-related crime)?
  - Both organized crime and general crime? Or just organized crime?

#### Security (Subjective)

- Should it potentially include:
  - Surveys on people‚Äôs feelings of safety in specific coastal regions?
  - Trust in law enforcement, visible presence of authorities, community initiatives?

### **Meeting Summaries**


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #1:** Recap & Next Steps

**Thank you for joining our first Safety & Security (SS) Goalkeeper meeting!**  
It was a great start to our work together in defining what safety & security means for the **Gulf of California**, and how it should be integrated into this assessment.  

::: {.callout-tip}

### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

The group agreed that **Safety & Security (SS)** is better conceptualized as a **type of pressure** rather than a standalone goal. This is because the Gulf of California does not inherently provide safety or security ‚Äî but SS influences the condition of many other goals.

However, unlike typical pressures, SS also affects the **current status** of several goals. The group proposed modeling SS as a **unique pressure** that impacts both the **current status** and the **likely future status**, with varying influence depending on the goal. For example, in **Natural Products**, SS could affect each product differently, with variable weights.

Jorge and V√≠ctor **identified goals most impacted** by crime and insecurity:

  - **Livelihoods & Economies** (individuals are limited in the jobs they can have)
  - **Tourism & Recreation** (locals and tourists may not want to visit certain places and may avoid certain coastal areas due to organized crime presence)
  - **Food Provision** (sector control, job insecurity, and threats of violence)
  - **Artisanal Opportunities** (physical access to the coast in certain areas are limited, and therefore access to marine resources for communities are limited)
  - **Sense of Place** (where communities do not feel that ‚Äúsense of belonging‚Äù to the Gulf because of safety perceptions or area avoidance)
  - **Clean Waters** (e.g., pollution from narco operations)
  - **Biodiversity** (e.g., crime-occupied habitats restrict conservation access)
  - **Research/Ocean Literacy** (e.g., limited scientific access or enforcement)
  - **Natural Products** (depending on the product)
  
But it would **not** affect the Carbon Storage/Coastal Protection goal. And, for the **Tourism & Recreation** goal, SS likely **does not affect the current status**, because current indicators already capture the effect of safety on travel behavior. SS would instead only influence the **likely future status** for this goal.

The group debated how to define "crime" in this context:

  - **V√≠ctor**: Include **all crime**, as it all has tangible effects.
  - **Jorge**: Emphasize **organized crime**, which has a particularly strong impact in the Gulf.
  - **Proposal**: Stay flexible in defining SS, as organized crime might be hard to isolate from general crime in available data.
  
The SS Goalkeeper Group also agreed on the need to avoid getting stuck in philosophical debates, keep the work **practical, grounded, and data-informed**, and consider broader socio-political factors like **state presence**, **poverty**, **education**, and **health services** in the analysis.

**Amy** emphasized incorporating both:

  - **Objective crime rates** (quantitative data), and
  - **Subjective perceptions of safety** (qualitative insight)
    - She noted that over time, communities may normalize insecurity, underestimating real risks. A possible resource: a **Packard-funded report**, possibly titled *"People Protecting Places (PPP)"*.
  
*This would support:*

| Term      | Possible definition based on our meeting                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Safety    | Objective condition of crime/incidence of threats           |
| Security  | Subjective perception; feelings of safety, trust in law enforcement, institutions |

### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> Next steps 

- [ ] Review the [SS introduction slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GCZWVmivMn4AGB6LoaqxCzxCEH_qYy87rUmY3Z-fryw/edit?usp=sharing) to revisit the main ideas.  
- [ ] Review the [Key Questions](#key-questions) and keep brainstorming.  
- [ ] Add your thoughts, ideas, and potential data sources to the ongoing [collaborative document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djLJpt2VB8fZLe518mnSzd6l7GaU1IQLpPlLuiK6flU/edit?tab=t.kyrkgpt50url).  

More topics to think about before our **next meeting**:

- Determine how to quantify and measure safety/security for both **current** and **future** status  
  - *for the OHI core team to consider:* for SS's integration into likely future status, should SS's trend from the last 3-5 years be used? While the current status each goal is impacted by the current status of SS?
- Identify which **OHI GoCA goals** are most affected by SS, and assign appropriate weights  
- Establish a **reference point** for an ideal SS state (e.g., no crime? government targets for crime reduction or safety perception?)
- Identify and review **relevant data sources** for crime/safety across sectors  
  - Explore government databases and municipal sites for existing indices  
- Explore metrics for organized crime‚Äôs impact on **conservation and governance capacity**  
  - Consider how to include both **general and organized crime** in the analysis  
- Investigate **pluralismo jur√≠dico** and **co-management** structures as possible frameworks

**Meeting agenda:**

- **Discussion**: What data sources are available to quantify "Safety" (the objective incidence of crime/threats) and "Security" (the subjective perception/feelings of safety, trust in law enforcement, and institutions)?
- Wrap up & next steps

Thank you, and I‚Äôm looking forward to our discussion!

### Additional Insights & Examples

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Expert Working Group (EWG): Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

- Could separate organized crime from other pressures in the framework, making it a goal
- Explore "Hugs not Drugs" approach (referencing social programs as alternatives)
- Account for perceived differences among the five states (e.g., Sinaloa vs. Sonora)

### Social Justice and Green Resilience

- Could think about social justice as a resilience metric in the global context, emphasizing equality of opportunities.
- Could consider green areas as a form of resilience, possibly using a UN data index.
