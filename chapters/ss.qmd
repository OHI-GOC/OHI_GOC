**This goal captures the sense that marine resources are not limited by safety concerns.**

<div class="custom-box">
{{< fa lightbulb >}} **This information is meant to help guide the process of developing the Gulf of California OHI!**

This goal is not currently included in the global OHI, but the Expert Working Group felt that safety and security has a large impact on the Gulf of California system's ability to sustainably provide people with the benefits and services they both need and desire from marine systems.

## Key Questions

As we explore the idea of incorporating **Safety & Security** into the OHI for the Gulf of California, it is important to clarify the *objective, the core definitions, potential structure, and measurement considerations* for this potential goal. Below are key discussion points and considerations to review.

### 1. Objective

Does the safety and security goal seem to be more of **a pressure on many other goals**, or a goal by itself?

**_To clarify intent:_**

- What do we want to achieve by adding Safety & Security to the OHI GoCA?
  - Increase visibility of safety issues in coastal/marine areas?
  - Drive new initiatives to reduce crime and promote safer environments?
    - Does a *safer* Gulf mean a *healthier* Gulf?
  
**_To clarify definitions:_**

- Does a *"healthy gulf"* mean people are objectively safe, feel safe, or both?
- Should the goal focus on actual crime rates, perceived safety, or a combination? Or something else entirely?

| Term      | Possible Definition                                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Safety    | Objective condition with low crime/incidence of threats           |
| Security  | Subjective perception; trust in law enforcement, institutions     |

### 2. Scope 

- Should "Safety" include only organized crime, or also theft, assault, kidnapping, etc.?
- Is the ideal scenario truly zero crime, or a "tolerable" minimum?
- How do we address the diversity of crimes and their impacts on coastal communities?

### 3. Measuring

#### Safety (Objective)

- Should it could potentially include:
  - Official crime statistics (coastal, marine, port-related crime)?
  - Both organized crime and general crime? Or just organized crime?

#### Security (Subjective)

- Should it could potentially include:
  - Surveys on people’s feelings of safety in specific coastal regions?
  - Trust in law enforcement, visible presence of authorities, community initiatives?

---

## Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

- Could separate organized crime from other pressures in the framework, making it a goal
- Explore "Hugs not Drugs" approach (referencing social programs as alternatives)
- Account for perceived differences among the five states (e.g., Sinaloa vs. Sonora)

### Social Justice and Green Resilience

- Could think about social justice as a resilience metric in the global context, emphasizing equality of opportunities.
- Could consider green areas as a form of resilience, possibly using a UN data index.

## This goal will require sensitivity in language and verbage used.
