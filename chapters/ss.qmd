**This goal captures the sense that marine resources are not limited by safety concerns.**

<div class="custom-box">
{{< fa lightbulb >}} **This information is meant to help guide the process of developing the Gulf of California OHI!**

This goal is not currently included in the global OHI, but the Expert Working Group felt that safety and security has a large impact on the Gulf of California system's ability to sustainably provide people with the benefits and services they both need and desire from marine systems.

## Key Questions

Could organized crime be considered a *pressure* for the **safety and security** goal?

Or does the safety and security goal seem to be more of **a pressure on many other goals**, and should therefore not be a goal itself?

Are there other ways to highlight the importance of this concept without having it as a separate goal?


## Considerations

- Could separate organized crime from other pressures in the framework
- Explore "Hugs not Drugs" approach (referencing social programs as alternatives)
- Account for perceived differences among the five states (e.g., Sinaloa vs. Sonora)

### Social Justice and Green Resilience

- Could think about social justice as a resilience metric in the global context, emphasizing equality of opportunities.
- Could consider green areas as a form of resilience, possibly using a UN data index.
