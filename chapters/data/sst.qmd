## Sea surface temperature for the Gulf of California

Sea surface temperature (SST) is a critical indicator of ocean health, influencing marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate patterns. Anomalies in SST can disrupt food webs, alter species distributions, and serve as climate change indicators based on their frequency and severity.

This page provides access to yearly SST data for the Gulf of California, from 1980 to 2023. Eventually this data could be used in creating a pressure layer for the OHI GoC project, identifying long-term patterns and assessing climate change impacts on foundation species in the Gulf.

## Average Sea Surface Temperature (1980–2023)

This tool displays the average sea surface temperature for each year from 1980 to 2023 in the Gulf of California. Use this visualization to explore temporal trends in SST across decades by selecting specific years of interest, or pressing "play" for an animation throughout the years.

## Comparing Recent SST Trends to a Historical Baseline

This interactive tool compares historical SST patterns (1980–2000) with recent conditions (2001–2023). Each year's average SST values were subtracted from the historical baseline (1980–2000) to highlight areas experiencing significant warming or cooling trends. Use this tool to identify regions that may require targeted conservation efforts by selecting specific years.

## Data Source

This dataset was downloaded from CEDA on January 16, 2025, as part of an ongoing effort to provide a pressure layer of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) for the Gulf of California.  It provides daily-mean sea surface temperatures (SST), presented on a global grid spanning from 1980 to present. It is a Level 4 product with gaps between daily observations filled using statistical methods.
