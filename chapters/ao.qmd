**This goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.**

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, especially in developing nations. Small-scale fishing is an important component of cultural identity and heritage.

> _Half the world’s fish harvest is captured by artisanal fishing families._

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

- **_Focus:_** Measures access to artisanal (small-scale) fishing for local communities who rely on it for food, livelihood, and cultural identity.  
- **_Not about:_** Does not measure amount of food or money/livelihoods generated by artisanal fisheries (these are covered under the Food Provisioning and Livelihoods and Economies goals). Recreational fishing (fishing for sport) may be included here or in the Tourism and Recreation goal. This goal does not include commercial fisheries.

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **artisanal opportunities** goal? 

Who should have **access** to marine resources? 

How can people's access to marine resources be **limited:**

  - Are coastlines accessible to locals? 
  - Is dock and road infrastructure adequate? 
  - Is permitting for fish harvest readily available? 
  - Are there programs that foster artisanal fishing opportunities?
  - Are artisanaly fished stocks sustainably managed so they are actually available for harvest?
  - Do people have the economic ability to access these resources?
  
 What percentage of fishing activities in the region are **commercial** versus **artisanal**?

## Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

### Permitting

- In Mexico, artisanal fishers generally need permits unless fishing from the shore.  
- Obtaining permits is **bureaucratically complex, expensive, and limited** — new permits are hard to get. 
- A **black market for permits** exists due to the difficulty of legal access. 


---

### Coastal Access and Gentrification

**Legal Access vs. Physical Reality**

- The high tide line and 10 meters inland are federally protected maritime zones; hotels and condos **do not legally own** beachfront — **public access is guaranteed**.
- However, **gentrification, foreign property ownership, and tourism development** restrict physical access to beaches and shorelines.
- In some regions **crime and safety concerns** restrict coastal access.
- **Rising tourism prices** (e.g., diving in Cabo Pulmo) **exclude locals economically**.
- **Social movements** in places like Sinaloa are actively resisting the loss of access.
- Overall, **coastal access points are decreasing** due to fencing and development — even as political efforts claim to support access rights.

---


### Specific Fisheries Issues

- The **mahi mahi fishery** is essential for local livelihoods but is often illegal unless classified as **sportfishing**, creating a conflict.
- **No increase in legal fishing effort is allowed** — permit numbers are capped.

::: {.callout-tip title="Ideas for Incorporation into the Index"}

- Represent **legal and physical access restrictions** explicitly  
- Track and distinguish impacts of **gentrification vs. tourism development**, but consider their interactions  
- Consider **security and crime** as key barriers
- Assess **economic affordability** of fishing and coastal activities, not just physical access  
- Evaluate the **complexity of the permit system** and **prevalence of IUU fishing**  
- Explore ways to measure access in terms of:
  - **Kilometers of accessible coastline** (not fenced or restricted)
  - **Socioeconomic demographics** of those with/without access  
- Highlight **resilience and local social movements** defending access rights  
- Consider whether this goal should be expanded to include **Scientific research access** which can be limited by **permit bureaucracy** and **security concerns**.
