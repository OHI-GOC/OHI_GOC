**This goal measures whether people have the opportunity to fish at a small local scales.**


> This information is meant to help guide the process of developing the Gulf of California OHI. This goal is included in the global OHI, but other regional assessments have cut or modified this goal to better meet their objectives for ocean health. For example, in a Canada OHI assessment, the perspective of Aboriginal communities, which has been absent from assessments at the global scale due to lack of information, was represented by redefining the artisanal fishing opportunities goal as the Aboriginal opportunity goal. The model will almost certainly be modified. For example, need is a component of the global analysis, but may not be relevant in a regional assessment.

#### Overview

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation, and livelihoods for many people around the world. This resource is particularly important in developing nations. As opposed to large, commercial fisheries that usually involve industrial, energy-intensive vessels and long trips, artisanal fisheries refer to households, cooperatives or small firms that use relatively small amounts of capital, energy and small fishing vessels (if any), make relatively short fishing trips, and use fish mainly for local consumption or trade.

Artisanal fishing opportunities measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. In other words, it measures the potential for artisanal fishing whether or not this potential is actually met. This goal, as constructed here, does not measure recreational fishing which is often done in developed countries. This goal also does not measure the actual amount of fish caught (which is included in Food Provision) or revenue generated (which is captured by Coastal Livelihood and Economies). 

A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.

#### Practical Guidance

Ideally, this goal will include a measure of of how easy or hard it is for residents to *access* ocean resources when they need them. Measures of access include institutional and/or government regulations that provide people with access to marine waters through open coastlines and docks, readily available permitting for fish harvest, and programs that foster artisanal fishing opportunities. Another measure of access is that fish are actually available, which can be estimated by assessing the health of targeted species (see Fisheries subgoal) or the general sustainability of fishing practices. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing. 

In the global analysis, the *need* for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line.

> NOTE: The benefits of Artisanal Fishing can be difficult to parse from other goals. For example, tonnage of artisanally-caught fish will typically be included in the Food Provision goal. Another example is that in the Baltic Sea region, Artisanal Opportunities is very closely connected to Tourism and Recreation since there are a lot of locals and tourists using the shared sea for enjoyment. It will be necessary to determine how to apportion the data.

The reference point will depend on the data and model. In most cases, the availability of better local data will allow for improvements to the Global OHI assessment model (see table below). 

[Other OHI+ analyses](https://oceanhealthindex.org/guidance/artisanal-fishing-opportunities/) have revised this goal to better reflect local concerns.
