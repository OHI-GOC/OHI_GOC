# **Working Definition** for the AO Goal
Members of coastal communities – including members of small-scale fishing communities and pueblos originarios – have access to marine resources that allow them to thrive. This includes legal and regulated access to marine resources, knowledge-based use rules, clear boundaries, clear decision-making spaces, and reliable follow-through to ensure access, sustainability, and equity long-term.

*This definition was defined by the Goalkeeper Group during Meeting #3. See the Meeting #3 tab below for more details.*

*Previous working definition (as of Meeting #2): The objective of the AO goal is to evaluate the conditions which allow members of small-scale fishing communities and pueblos originarios to thrive - including legal, regulated access to marine resources, knowledge-based use rules, clear boundaries, clear decision-making spaces, and reliable follow-through to ensure access, sustainability, and equity long-term.*

# **About** the AO Goal

Typically, this goal measures whether people who need to fish on a
small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. **In the GoC, this goal
may be redefined to include artisanal opportunities more broadly.**

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a
critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood
opportunities for many people around the world, especially in developing
nations. Small-scale fishing is an important component of cultural
identity and heritage. Half the world’s fish harvest is captured by
artisanal fishing families.

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **GOAL FOCUS**

-   ***Focus:*** Typically measures access to artisanal (small-scale) fishing for
    local communities who rely on it for food, livelihood, and cultural
    identity.\
-   ***Not about:*** This goal does not measure amount of food or
    money / livelihoods generated by artisanal fisheries (these are
    covered under the Food Provisioning and Livelihoods and Economies
    goals). Recreational fishing or fishing for sport may be included
    here or in the Tourism and Recreation goal. This goal does not
    include commercial fisheries.
:::

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **artisanal opportunities** goal?

Who should have **access** to marine resources?

How can people's access to marine resources be limited?

-   Are coastlines accessible to locals?
-   Is dock and road infrastructure adequate?
-   Is permitting for fish harvest readily available?
-   Are there programs that foster artisanal fishing opportunities?
-   Are artisanal fish stocks managed sustainably and are they are
    actually available for harvest?
-   Do people have the economic ability to access these resources?

What percentage of fishing activities in the region are *commercial*
versus *artisanal*?

## **AO Meeting #1: Summary** - July 22
**Meeting #1** introduced participants and their research backgrounds related to the Gulf of California, with Erica facilitating and providing an overview of the Ocean Health Index. The group discussed the index's methodology and application to the Gulf of California region, including its assessment of various ocean health goals and the team’s need to define ‘artisanal opportunities’ beyond fishing. The conversation ended with participants agreeing to further explore concepts like resource access and sustainable livelihoods.

## **AO Meeting #2: Summary** - August 19
The main focus of **Meeting #2** was to solidify the goal definition before selecting model indicators. In this context, our ‘model’ will be a series of indicators intended to capture the definition of the goal; it will probably not be very mathematically complicated. Erica outlined the goal workflow – a six-step process from step 1 (defining the goal) to step 6 (verifying model outputs). The team discussed various aspects of AO including social and economic importance of fishing access, access to other resources, and access to important spaces. Victor presented current work related to this topic, including measures of food sovereignty and community well-being. The group came closer to solidifying the definition of AO, which will include some measure of community resource access. Participants agreed to finalize the goal’s definition at the next meeting, where we will also try to select indicators. Please come to the next meeting prepared to settle the AO definition and suggest relevant indicators.

## **AO Meeting #3: Summary** - September 23
**In Meeting #3**, the team solidified the AO goal definition:
*Members of coastal communities – including members of small-scale fishing communities and pueblos originarios – have access to marine resources that allow them to thrive. This includes legal and regulated access to marine resources, knowledge-based use rules, clear boundaries, clear decision-making spaces, and reliable follow-through to ensure access, sustainability, and equity long-term.*

Next the team explored various indicators for measuring AO, including artisanal fishing opportunities, Indigenous use opportunities, and coastal access, while considering cultural, legal, and socioeconomic factors that affect use. They discussed challenges in selecting appropriate indicators for measuring Indigenous use and artisanal fishing opportunities, with plans to further investigate data sources and develop a preliminary model for review at the next meeting.

**Plan for AO Meeting #4:** We will continue our discussion of AO indicators and technical reference points, and Erica will propose an AO model that we can critique as a group. **Please come prepared to share your perspective on the proposed model and appropriate indicators.** In doing so, please also keep in mind that we will need to select an appropriate technical reference point for each indicator – a "baseline". The closer or further away we are from the technical reference point according to some indicator X, the higher or lower the AO score will be. If an indicator does not have a technical reference point associated with it, it will be difficult if not impossible for us to parameterize it within the goal model.

## **AO Meeting #4: Summary** - October 21
**In Meeting 4**, the OHI Core team presented an **initial dummy model** for the group to discuss and critique. The group explored the proposed components of the Artisanal Opportunities goal model, including indicators for the sub-goals of **Local Coastal Access (LCA)** and **Artisanal Fishing Opportunities (AFO)**. As part of this process, they discussed various aspects of Mexican artisanal fisheries, including transportation infrastructure and regulatory frameworks that promote or restrict fishing and coastal access.The OHI Core Team had proposed using **subsidy dollars** as one type of indicator for AFO and LCA. However —except for the [**BIENPESCA Program**](https://mexicobusiness.news/agribusiness/news/bienpesca-program-benefits-over-168000-fishers) (que brinda apoyo a los pescadores a través de lo que es esencialmente una forma de ingreso básico universal) (which provides support to fishers through what is essentially a type of universal basic income)— **fishing subsidies are no longer in use in Mexico as of 2018 and 2019**. The meeting ended with a discussion about **alternative indicators**, particularly those that will capture small-scale fishery access and stock sustainability.

# Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## **EWG Meeting #1** - Regional Considerations for AO

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

### Permitting

-   In Mexico, artisanal fishers generally need permits unless fishing
    from the shore.\
-   Obtaining permits is bureaucratically complex, expensive, and
    limited — new permits are hard to get.
-   A **black market for permits** exists due to the difficulty of legal
    access.

### Coastal Access and Gentrification

**Legal Access vs. Physical Reality**

-   The high tide line and 10 meters inland are federally protected
    maritime zones; hotels and condos do not legally own beachfront. Public access is guaranteed.
-   However, gentrification, foreign property ownership, and tourism
    development restrict physical access to beaches and shorelines.
-   In some regions crime and safety concerns restrict coastal
    access.
-   Rising tourism prices (e.g., diving in Cabo Pulmo) exclude
    locals economically.
-   Social movements in places like Sinaloa are actively resisting
    the loss of access.
-   Overall, coastal access points are decreasing due to fencing and
    development — even as political efforts claim to support access
    rights.

### Specific Fisheries Issues

-   The mahi mahi fishery is essential for local livelihoods but is
    often illegal unless classified as sportfishing, creating a
    conflict.
-   No increase in legal fishing effort is allowed. Permit numbers
    are capped.

::: {.callout-tip title="Ideas for Incorporation into the Index"}
-   Represent **legal and physical access restrictions** explicitly\
-   Track and distinguish impacts of **gentrification vs. tourism
    development**, but consider their interactions\
-   Consider **security and crime** as key barriers
-   Assess to **economic affordability of fishing and coastal activities**,
    not just physical access\
-   Evaluate the **complexity of the permit system** and prevalence of
    **IUU fishing**\
-   Explore ways to measure access in terms of:
    -   Kilometers of accessible coastline (not fenced or
        restricted)
    -   Socioeconomic demographics of those with/without access\
-   Highlight **resilience and local social movements** defending access
    rights\
-   Consider expanding this goal to include scientific research access\ which can be limited by **permit bureaucracy** and security concerns.
