# **Getting Started**

**Typically, this goal measures whether people who need to fish on a
small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. In the GoC, this goal
may be redefined to include artisanal opportunities more broadly.**

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a
critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood
opportunities for many people around the world, especially in developing
nations. Small-scale fishing is an important component of cultural
identity and heritage. Half the world’s fish harvest is captured by
artisanal fishing families.

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **GOAL FOCUS**

-   ***Focus:*** Typically measures access to artisanal (small-scale) fishing for
    local communities who rely on it for food, livelihood, and cultural
    identity.\
-   ***Not about:*** This goal does not measure amount of food or
    money / livelihoods generated by artisanal fisheries (these are
    covered under the Food Provisioning and Livelihoods and Economies
    goals). Recreational fishing or fishing for sport may be included
    here or in the Tourism and Recreation goal. This goal does not
    include commercial fisheries.

## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **artisanal opportunities**
goal?

Who should have **access** to marine resources?

How can people's access to marine resources be **limited:**

-   Are coastlines accessible to locals?
-   Is dock and road infrastructure adequate?
-   Is permitting for fish harvest readily available?
-   Are there programs that foster artisanal fishing opportunities?
-   Are artisanal fish stocks managed sustainably and are they are
    actually available for harvest?
-   Do people have the economic ability to access these resources?

What percentage of fishing activities in the region are **commercial**
versus **artisanal**?

## AO Goalkeeper Meeting #1: Summary
**Meeting #1** introduced participants and their research backgrounds related to the Gulf of California, with Erica facilitating and providing an overview of the Ocean Health Index. The group discussed the index's methodology and application to the Gulf of California region, including its assessment of various ocean health goals and the team’s need to define ‘artisanal opportunities’ beyond fishing. The conversation ended with participants agreeing to further explore concepts like resource access and sustainable livelihoods. 

**In Meeting #2**, we will discuss how we might measure access to 'artisanal opportunities' in the Gulf, and possible AO reference points, so please come prepared for this discussion. A reference point is defined as the ideal state of artisanal opportunities in the GoC.

The presentation slides and notes from meeting #1 can be accessed in the group's google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1VUuocKEk9TqgssSgzeFb6y5LGtEoKQ2a).

# **Expert Working Group (EWG) Meetings**

## EWG Meeting #1: Regional Considerations

These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group.

### Permitting

-   In Mexico, artisanal fishers generally need permits unless fishing
    from the shore.\
-   Obtaining permits is **bureaucratically complex, expensive, and
    limited** — new permits are hard to get.
-   A **black market for permits** exists due to the difficulty of legal
    access.

### Coastal Access and Gentrification

**Legal Access vs. Physical Reality**

-   The high tide line and 10 meters inland are federally protected
    maritime zones; hotels and condos **do not legally own** beachfront
    — **public access is guaranteed**.
-   However, **gentrification, foreign property ownership, and tourism
    development** restrict physical access to beaches and shorelines.
-   In some regions **crime and safety concerns** restrict coastal
    access.
-   **Rising tourism prices** (e.g., diving in Cabo Pulmo) **exclude
    locals economically**.
-   **Social movements** in places like Sinaloa are actively resisting
    the loss of access.
-   Overall, **coastal access points are decreasing** due to fencing and
    development — even as political efforts claim to support access
    rights.

### Specific Fisheries Issues

-   The **mahi mahi fishery** is essential for local livelihoods but is
    often illegal unless classified as **sportfishing**, creating a
    conflict.
-   **No increase in legal fishing effort is allowed** — permit numbers
    are capped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-tip title="Ideas for Incorporation into the Index"}
-   Represent **legal and physical access restrictions** explicitly\
-   Track and distinguish impacts of **gentrification vs. tourism
    development**, but consider their interactions\
-   Consider **security and crime** as key barriers
-   Assess **economic affordability** of fishing and coastal activities,
    not just physical access\
-   Evaluate the **complexity of the permit system** and **prevalence of
    IUU fishing**\
-   Explore ways to measure access in terms of:
    -   **Kilometers of accessible coastline** (not fenced or
        restricted)
    -   **Socioeconomic demographics** of those with/without access\
-   Highlight **resilience and local social movements** defending access
    rights\
-   Consider whether this goal should be expanded to include
    **Scientific research access** which can be limited by **permit
    bureaucracy** and **security concerns**.
