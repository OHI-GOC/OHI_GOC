# <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>  About the CW Goal

**This goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes.**

::: {.custom-box}

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

People *value* marine waters that are **free of pollution and debris** for aesthetic and health reasons. 

Contamination of waters comes from oil spills, chemicals, eutrophication, algal blooms, disease pathogens (e.g., fecal coliform, viruses, and parasites from sewage outflow), floating trash, and mass kills of organisms due to pollution. 

People are sensitive to these phenomena occurring in areas they access for recreation or other purposes as well as for simply knowing that clean waters exist. 

In the global assessment, four measures of pollution are included in the *clean waters* goal: eutrophication (nutrients), chemicals, pathogens and marine debris. **This group will assess what contamination applies to the Gulf, and will define the goal model accordingly.**

The status of these components is typically the inverse of their intensity.  This means that the high input results in low status score, *and this goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero.*

:::


## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **clean waters** goal? 

- How do we *ideally* measure the amount of **contamination** (or lack thereof) of waters in the Gulf of California?

- How do we define the **reference point**, or the ideal amount of contamination?  Is it **zero**, as it is in the global framework? 
  - This may depend on what we want to include in the status of the goal. Does it include chemicals, pathogens, trash, nutrients?  Are there any other types of contamination we want to add or remove?
  - The global OHI defined the contamination categories based on commonly considered contamination types in assessments of coastal clean waters ([Borja et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2008.07.005)), are there papers like this for the Gulf of California?

### **Meeting Summaries**


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #1:** Recap & Next Steps

**Thank you to everyone who joined our first Clean Waters (CW) Goalkeeper meeting!**  

This initial session introduced the OHI Gulf of California assessment and set the stage for how future meetings will unfold. It was a great start to our work together in defining what **_clean waters_** mean for the **Gulf of California**.   

::: {.callout-tip}

#### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

While this meeting mostly served as an introduction, we had a great discussion about possible **components of the Clean Waters goal** for the **Gulf of California**.  

- Ideally, we aim to **identify the sources** of contamination, though this may not always be feasible with available data.
- Some **contaminants** dissolve in freshwater but **condensate upon entering seawater**, causing them to adhere to **marine sediments**.
- José Antonio shared insights from a paper he’s working on with Ben, which could help us quantify **nitrogen (N)** and **phosphorus (P)** in coastal regions around the Gulf.
- Miguel noted the existence of a **seafood alert system**: when harmful algal blooms or poor water quality are detected, advisories are issued against eating **shellfish** farmed in affected areas. [From COFEPRIS?]

##### <i class="fa-solid fa-vial-virus"></i> Key Contaminant Categories Discussed:

- **Nutrients**  
  - Turbidity (suspended sediments)  
  - Nitrogen  
  - Phosphorus  
  - Organic matter (BOD/COD)  

- **Chemicals**  
  - Hydrocarbons from ships (oil/diesel)  
  - Heavy metals  
  - Pesticides / Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)  
  - Microplastics  
  - Human-caused accidents (e.g., acid spills, harmful algal blooms)  
  - Pharmaceuticals  

- **Pathogens**  
  - Bacterial: fecal coliforms, *E. coli*  
  - *Vibrio* species  
  - Viral pathogens  

- **Marine Debris**  
  - Plastic pollution  
  - Abandoned fishing gear (nets, lines)  
  - Microplastics (also listed under Chemicals)  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some contaminants, like microplastics, fall into **multiple categories**, such as both **Chemicals** and **Marine Debris**. If you think it should be in one category versus another, please note this on the CW Model Notes document.

:::

#### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Next Steps**

- [ ] Review and contribute to the [CW Model Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhF0Wf9g4VH-iDHVK07Qk2FdLBZNtWXTxdxrRecbF-Q/edit?tab=t.kyrkgpt50url) document.  
  - Add any **additional contaminants**, **sources**, or **relevant datasets**.
- [ ] Review the [Key Questions](#key-questions) and continue brainstorming how we might assess:  
  - **Presence**, **frequency**, and **sources** of these contaminants  
  - Potential **reference points** or thresholds  
- [ ] Review the [CW introduction slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MhTPHz6HSe0NVeA3UcxgCPXBzhQ9l6VAMkSiQkBCeNk/edit?usp=sharing) to revisit the main ideas. 

In our **next meeting**, we’ll continue our discussion of contaminants that should be considered in this goal.  

We'll also start to define the **reference point** for this goal — our vision of what ideal, clean waters look like. In assessment terms, this is the **"100" score** — our A+ target!

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #2:** Defining the *Ideal State* of Clean Waters  

**Thank you to everyone who joined our second Clean Waters (CW) Goalkeeper meeting!**  

This session built upon our introduction in Meeting #1. We began to define what **_clean waters_** mean in an *ideal world* for the Gulf of California, and brainstormed possible **indicators** to measure progress toward this goal.  

---

::: {.callout-tip}

#### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

We reviewed **Meeting #1** takeaways:  

- The **OHI GoCA project** is part of a *three-legged stool* framework: Index, Investment, Action.  
- The **Clean Waters goal** captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes, with implications for ecosystem health, human recreation, and food safety.  
- **Contamination categories** include: Eutrophication (nutrients), Chemicals, Pathogens, and Marine Debris.  

We then focused on two key questions:  

1. What is the **ideal state** of Clean Waters in the Gulf of California?  
2. What **indicators** could capture this state in practice?  

---

##### <i class="fa-solid fa-wave"></i> *The Ideal State of Clean Waters*

- **No contamination** of marine and coastal waters  
- **Safe swimming & recreation** (no beach closures)  
- **Safe seafood** (low heavy metal content)  
- **No spills or illegal dumping**  
- **Healthy ecosystems**: fish biomass, species richness, trophic balance, and habitat recovery **_(will be covered in the Biodiversity goal)_**

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i>  **Meeting #3:** Data Sources & Reference Points

**_During our group activity on the Clean Waters goal, we focused on identifying key contaminants, possible data sources, and technical reference points to evaluate the extent to which local waters remain free from human-caused pollution._**

<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>[**Meeting #3 Activity**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhF0Wf9g4VH-iDHVK07Qk2FdLBZNtWXTxdxrRecbF-Q/edit?tab=t.2zz7o4vt68td)

Throughout the discussion, we organized our work around four main categories of contaminants: **pathogens, nutrients (eutrophication), chemicals, and marine debris**. For each category, we reviewed existing data sources, their limitations, and possible indicators for evaluation.

- **Pathogens:**  
  We considered data from **CONAGUA** (wastewater treatment plant inventories), the **Clean Beaches Program** from COFEPRIS, and international guidelines (WHO). The group highlighted the uncertainty of wastewater treatment efficiency in rural areas and the reliability of official program data compared with scientific literature. Bacterial indicators such as *E. coli* and enterococci, as well as viruses introduced from human sewage, were discussed as indicators.

- **Nutrients (Eutrophication):**  
  Possible data sources included nutrient output models from aquaculture and agriculture, records of sanitary closures and red tide events, and the **HAEDAT** database of harmful algal blooms (HABs). The group emphasized the importance of nature-based solutions for nutrient management and combining satellite monitoring with in-situ measurements to better predict and track harmful algal blooms (HABs).  
  
  As of now, the OHI Core Team feels that tracking HAB events in the GoC is the best indicator.  This is because nutrient inputs in the marine system are not necessarily bad *unless they cause a HAB that affects both the species there, and humans.* Therefore, it would make more sense to track HABs, rather than try to estimate how much nutrient pollution becomes an issue.  

- **Chemicals:**  
  Discussions focused on pesticides, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons. Sources included SEMARNAT and mining industry databases, as well as scientific studies using bioindicators (bivalves, fish). We noted the importance of evaluating mining practices, tracking oil spills, and assessing compliance with “clean fleet” fuel and waste management policies.
  
  SEMARNAT has the most promising data for heavy metals and hydrocarbons in coastal areas, as they have the number of contaminated sites by entity, municipality, year (2015-2025), and type/name of contaminant; Hazardous waste generation estimates by types of waste, from 2017 - 2025 by state and by municipio; and a list of contaminated and remediated sites with their exact location and the year they were identified/remediated.

- **Marine Debris:**  
  The group examined both micro- and macroplastics, citing recent studies on fish and sea lions, along with the **National Inventory of Plastic Pollution Sources**. Possible reference points could be improving waste management practices in coastal communities and considering policies on single-use plastics.

Overall, the group agreed that the main challenge is **identifying/harmonizing diverse data sources** and defining **clear technical reference points** to translate this information into meaningful indicators for the Clean Waters goal in the Gulf of California.

---

**_NEXT STEPS:_**

- Miguel will reach out to Dr. Paez-Osuna for data used in the [Environmental Status of the Gulf of California](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825217300429?via%3Dihub) paper from 2017.
- We will continue to evaluate the usability of data (Clean beach program report (programa playas limpias) / COFEPRIS / CONAGUA)
- Jaqueline will advise us on inconsistencies in the Playas Limpias program.

---

**Thank you all for your thoughtful input and time! We are so appreciative of the collective effort that will be necessary to obtain robust CW scores.**

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #4:** Indicators, Reference Points, and Clean Waters Components  

**_In this fourth meeting of the Clean Waters working group, we reviewed the selected indicators, potential reference points, and data sources for each component of the goal. We also discussed methodological adjustments and included a new component (sedimentation)._**

<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> [**Meeting #4 Presentation**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lcz5MCcrPlvjJ6A_8fyXEMVvQz6zjRNVERRy7ZR44HY/edit?usp=sharing)

The OHI Core Team presented progress on structuring pollution indicators and identifying usable data sources. Discussion focused on how to interpret, scale, and combine different types of data into a single, meaningful score.

---

### **Summary of Discussion**

- **Overall structure of the goal:**  
  The group reaffirmed that the Clean Waters goal aims to capture the extent to which local waters remain unpolluted by human activities. The main components continue to be **eutrophication, pathogens, chemicals, and marine debris**, with the new and tentative addition of **sedimentation** as a fifth, separate component.

- **Methodology and aggregation:**  
  The goalkeeper team reviewed how each indicator will be scaled from 0 - 100 and then combined within each component, which will then be combined into an overall Clean Waters score.  
  Miguel suggested using **example or mock data** to visualize how indicator scores behave under different scenarios before deciding on an aggregation method (geometric or weighted mean).  
  The OHI Core Team will prep to discuss this in detail in the next meeting on November 18th.

---

### **Reviewed Components**

#### **1. Eutrophication**  
- The group agreed to **focus indicators on observable negative outcomes**, rather than absolute nutrient levels (N and P).  
- It was validated that **harmful algal bloom (HAB) occurrence** should be the main indicator, using data from the **HAEDAT** database (1979–2023), with an emphasis on identifying regional trends and potential causes.  
- Jacqueline and Miguel recommended comparing each region with itself over time, since natural conditions vary greatly.  
- Melanie suggested weighting events based on their ecological or human impact, since not all HABs cause the same level of stress.  
- The inclusion of **chlorophyll-a satellite data (Copernicus Marine)** was supported as an additional indicator to detect increases in algal biomass compared to historical concentrations.

#### **2. Sedimentation (potential new component)**  
- The group discussed separating **sedimentation and turbidity** into a new component, as they do not always coincide with eutrophication.  
- **Miguel** linked sedimentation to **erosion and deforestation** in upper watersheds, while **Jacqueline** noted its natural influence in the Upper Gulf (Colorado River discharges and strong tidal mixing).  
- It was agreed that potential indicators could include **Secchi depth (Copernicus Marine Service / CONABIO)** or **total suspended solids (CONAGUA RENAMECA)**, analyzed as deviations from historical averages.

#### **3. Pathogens**  
- Two main indicators were confirmed:  
  1. **Beach suitability (APTA/no APTA)** -- based on enterococcus levels from the *Playas Limpias* program (COFEPRIS). 
  
     - Access to historical data remains a challenge, and requests have been submitted through the **National Transparency Platform**.  
     - Melanie suggested that, because this is direct human contamination, the **reference point could simply be “zero contamination”**, without requiring long-term historical series.

  2. **Sewage inputs** -- modeled using coastal population data, sanitation access, and wastewater treatment efficiency.  
     - The OHI Core Team will continue to search *INEGI* and *CONAGUA* for data on who has access to sanitation facilities, how the sanitation systems in México work, and how efficient they are in removing pathogens.

#### **4. Chemicals**  
- The group reviewed data from **SEMARNAT** on hazardous waste sites and chemical pollutants, including **pesticides, hydrocarbons, and heavy metals**.  
- The most promising dataset is: **Contaminated and remediated sites** (by state, municipality, year, remediation program, waste type, etc).
- These data provide the opportunity to evaluate both **point-source pollution** and **remediation efforts**, helping to capture the balance between contamination and recovery.  
- Jacqueline suggested that indicators should not only record whether programs or facilities exist, but also evaluate their **operational efficiency or level of compliance**.  
- Miguel emphasized that this component could include a **resilience-type indicator**, such as the number or effectiveness of **programs to eliminate point sources** (e.g., clean fleet policies, industrial wastewater controls).
- **Indicators of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and vessel pollution in the GoC do not currently have data source identified for them.** Everyone will continue to research these topics.

#### **5. Marine Debris**  
- The group discussed both **macroplastics and microplastics**.
- Potential indicators include:  
  - **Management condition of coastal waste sites** from SEMARNAT -- assuming better management reduces plastic leakage into the ocean.  
  - **Policies or bans** related to single-use plastics, as suggested by Miguel, in which these have a big impact on the plastic pollution that makes it ot the ocean.  
  - **Organized beach cleanups**, as a measure of community action and mitigation.  
- It was agreed that this component should combine **management-based indicators** (preventive) and **removal-based indicators** (reactive) to better reflect progress toward cleaner coastal waters.

---

### **Next Steps**

- The OHI team will present **preliminary indicator scores** and possibly some mock combinations at the next meeting to illustrate how indicators and weights can behave in combination.  
- Sophia will circulate updated summary statistics of **HAB events filtered to include only Gulf of California municipalities**.  
- The team will continue evaluating the **inclusion of sedimentation as a fifth component**, and follow up on access to Playa Limpias data through transparency requests.
