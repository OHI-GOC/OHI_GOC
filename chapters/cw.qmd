# <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>  About the CW Goal

**This goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes.**

::: {.custom-box}

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITION**

People *value* marine waters that are **free of pollution and debris** for aesthetic and health reasons. 

Contamination of waters comes from oil spills, chemicals, eutrophication, algal blooms, disease pathogens (e.g., fecal coliform, viruses, and parasites from sewage outflow), floating trash, and mass kills of organisms due to pollution. 

People are sensitive to these phenomena occurring in areas they access for recreation or other purposes as well as for simply knowing that clean waters exist. 

In the global assessment, four measures of pollution are included in the *clean waters* goal: eutrophication (nutrients), chemicals, pathogens and marine debris. **This group will assess what contamination applies to the Gulf, and will define the goal model accordingly.**

The status of these components is typically the inverse of their intensity.  This means that the high input results in low status score, *and this goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero.*

:::


## Key Questions

What is the ideal sustainable state of the **clean waters** goal? 

- How do we *ideally* measure the amount of **contamination** (or lack thereof) of waters in the Gulf of California?

- How do we define the **reference point**, or the ideal amount of contamination?  Is it **zero**, as it is in the global framework? 
  - This may depend on what we want to include in the status of the goal. Does it include chemicals, pathogens, trash, nutrients?  Are there any other types of contamination we want to add or remove?
  - The global OHI defined the contamination categories based on commonly considered contamination types in assessments of coastal clean waters ([Borja et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2008.07.005)), are there papers like this for the Gulf of California?

### **Meeting Summaries**


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #1:** Recap & Next Steps

**Thank you to everyone who joined our first Clean Waters (CW) Goalkeeper meeting!**  

This initial session introduced the OHI Gulf of California assessment and set the stage for how future meetings will unfold. It was a great start to our work together in defining what **_clean waters_** mean for the **Gulf of California**.   

::: {.callout-tip}

#### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

While this meeting mostly served as an introduction, we had a great discussion about possible **components of the Clean Waters goal** for the **Gulf of California**.  

- Ideally, we aim to **identify the sources** of contamination, though this may not always be feasible with available data.
- Some **contaminants** dissolve in freshwater but **condensate upon entering seawater**, causing them to adhere to **marine sediments**.
- José Antonio shared insights from a paper he’s working on with Ben, which could help us quantify **nitrogen (N)** and **phosphorus (P)** in coastal regions around the Gulf.
- Miguel noted the existence of a **seafood alert system**: when harmful algal blooms or poor water quality are detected, advisories are issued against eating **shellfish** farmed in affected areas. [From COFEPRIS?]

##### <i class="fa-solid fa-vial-virus"></i> Key Contaminant Categories Discussed:

- **Nutrients**  
  - Turbidity (suspended sediments)  
  - Nitrogen  
  - Phosphorus  
  - Organic matter (BOD/COD)  

- **Chemicals**  
  - Hydrocarbons from ships (oil/diesel)  
  - Heavy metals  
  - Pesticides / Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)  
  - Microplastics  
  - Human-caused accidents (e.g., acid spills, harmful algal blooms)  
  - Pharmaceuticals  

- **Pathogens**  
  - Bacterial: fecal coliforms, *E. coli*  
  - *Vibrio* species  
  - Viral pathogens  

- **Marine Debris**  
  - Plastic pollution  
  - Abandoned fishing gear (nets, lines)  
  - Microplastics (also listed under Chemicals)  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some contaminants, like microplastics, fall into **multiple categories**, such as both **Chemicals** and **Marine Debris**. If you think it should be in one category versus another, please note this on the CW Model Notes document.

:::

::: {.callout-important}

#### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Next Steps**

- [ ] Review and contribute to the [CW Model Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhF0Wf9g4VH-iDHVK07Qk2FdLBZNtWXTxdxrRecbF-Q/edit?tab=t.kyrkgpt50url) document.  
  - Add any **additional contaminants**, **sources**, or **relevant datasets**.
- [ ] Review the [Key Questions](#key-questions) and continue brainstorming how we might assess:  
  - **Presence**, **frequency**, and **sources** of these contaminants  
  - Potential **reference points** or thresholds  
- [ ] Review the [CW introduction slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MhTPHz6HSe0NVeA3UcxgCPXBzhQ9l6VAMkSiQkBCeNk/edit?usp=sharing) to revisit the main ideas. 

In our **next meeting**, we’ll continue our discussion of contaminants that should be considered in this goal.  

We'll also start to define the **reference point** for this goal — our vision of what ideal, clean waters look like. In assessment terms, this is the **"100" score** — our A+ target!

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #2:** Defining the *Ideal State* of Clean Waters  

**Thank you to everyone who joined our second Clean Waters (CW) Goalkeeper meeting!**  

This session built upon our introduction in Meeting #1. We began to define what **_clean waters_** mean in an *ideal world* for the Gulf of California, and brainstormed possible **indicators** to measure progress toward this goal.  

---

::: {.callout-tip}

#### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

We reviewed **Meeting #1** takeaways:  

- The **OHI GoCA project** is part of a *three-legged stool* framework: Index, Investment, Action.  
- The **Clean Waters goal** captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes, with implications for ecosystem health, human recreation, and food safety.  
- **Contamination categories** include: Eutrophication (nutrients), Chemicals, Pathogens, and Marine Debris.  

We then focused on two key questions:  

1. What is the **ideal state** of Clean Waters in the Gulf of California?  
2. What **indicators** could capture this state in practice?  

---

##### <i class="fa-solid fa-wave"></i> *The Ideal State of Clean Waters*  
In a perfect world, clean waters in the Gulf would mean:  

- **No contamination** of marine and coastal waters  
- **Safe swimming & recreation** (no beach closures)  
- **Safe seafood** (low heavy metal content)  
- **No spills or illegal dumping**  
- **Healthy ecosystems**: fish biomass, species richness, trophic balance, and habitat recovery **_(will be covered in the Biodiversity goal)_**

---

  Identifies *pollution from economic activities* as one of the four major environmental problems in the region (focus of CW goal).  

  *Key Contamination Findings (from literature review):*  

  - **Nutrients & Eutrophication**  
    - Reported mainly in estuaries and lagoons of the north and central Gulf, especially those influenced by aquaculture (shrimp farms) and agriculture runoff.  
    - Indicators: dissolved oxygen (hypoxia), chlorophyll-a, and nutrient concentrations (N, P).  

  - **Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)**  
    - More frequent and intense in the southern Gulf and central coastal lagoons, with records of sanitary closures and red tide events.  
    - Indicators: phytoplankton cell counts, chlorophyll-a, closure events.  

  - **Chemicals**  
    - *Metals & metalloids:* higher concentrations in northern Gulf estuaries near mining and industrial activities.  
    - *Pesticides & POPs:* concentrated in central and southern Gulf, especially in fishing grounds and near agriculture zones.  
    - *Hydrocarbons (oil, diesel):* localized near ports, coastal urban centers, and oil transport routes (mainly central/southern Gulf).  

  - **Pathogens**  
    - Fecal contamination reported in coastal waters near urban centers (ex: Mazatlán, Guaymas, La Paz).  

  - **Marine Debris**  
    - Macro- and microplastics recorded in surface waters of the central Gulf and in sediments/organisms throughout the Gulf, with hotspots near urbanized coasts and fishing activity zones.

##### Weather and Climate Impacts

- Rainfall increases trash accumulation and degrades water quality
- Hurricanes and storms create additional ecosystem pressure
- Intermittent river systems cause sudden freshwater inputs that marine ecosystems cannot handle

### Ecosystem and Community Impacts

##### Invasive Species Effects

- Cattails provide natural filtration but face threats from invasive Placostomos
- Non-native species have fundamentally altered community structures
- Root system damage impacts native fish populations like tilapia

##### Aquaculture Concerns

- Shrimp farms generate nutrient runoff affecting other fisheries
- Eutrophication problems documented by local fishermen
- Pathogen issues primarily affect swimming areas

##### Unique Regional Challenges

- Dependence on ocean-derived freshwater for drinking water
- Questions about integrating water quality standards into ocean health goals

### Monitoring and Assessment Approaches

##### Community-Based Efforts

- Organized trash pickups throughout the Gulf
- Volunteer diving cleanup programs
- Local community engagement in monitoring efforts

##### Scientific Assessment Tools

- TRIX Index: Combines chlorophyll-a and nutrient data to classify water as eutrophic or oligotrophic
- Satellite monitoring: Provides temporal analysis capabilities
- Biological indicators: Cannonball jellyfish appearance signals hypoxic conditions and dead zones

###### Case Study: Santa Maria Lagoon

- 10-year TRIX analysis revealed dramatic ecosystem shift
- System changed from nutrient sink to nutrient exporter
- Demonstrates rapid ecological changes in regional waters

### Emerging Pollution Concerns

##### Noise and Light Pollution

- Ship noise impacts whale communication and behavior
- Industrial development pressures highlighted by "Whales or Gas?" campaign
- Questions about classifying noise/light as water quality threats

##### Synergistic Effects

- Nutrients and chemicals interact to create algal blooms
- Need for multiplier effects in assessment methodologies
- Complex interactions require integrated pollution assessment approaches
