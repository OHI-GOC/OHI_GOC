**This goal measures human connections to the marine environment that provide a deep sense of identity and belonging.**

Feelings of identity and belonging stem from – for example:

-   Sense of identity within a community
-   Connection(s) to place(s)
-   Connections to plants and animals

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITIONS**

In the global framework, these are the definitions of the goal and subgoals (Iconic Species, and Lasting Special Places):

**Sense of Place (Goal)**

*Definition*: Captures aspects of coastal and marine systems that people value as part of their cultural identity.  There was a proposed alternative name: "Sense of belonging" *(suggested by Marlu)*

**Iconic Species (Subgoal)**

*Definition*: Species relevant to local cultural identity through traditional activities (fishing, hunting, commerce), local ethnic or religious practices, existence value, and locally-recognized aesthetic value (tourism, art subjects).

**Lasting Special Places (Subgoal)**

*Definition*: Geographic locations with particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational, or existence reasons.  These areas are then assessed by their protection levels/status for these valued locations.

## **Meeting #1 Recap & Next Steps**

**Thank you for joining our first Sense of Belonging (SB) Goalkeeper meeting!**  
It was a great start to our work together in defining what sense of belonging and place means for the **Gulf of California**, and how it should be integrated into this assessment.  

::: {.callout-tip}

### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

During our discussion, experts of the group emphasized the importance of artisanal fishing communities and their **multi-generational ties to the sea**, and that the sense of belonging has a big connection to both past and future generations. 

- While it was noted that artisanal fishing already has its own goal, it was then discussed whether identity- and community-based aspects should be incorporated separately.  We will likely define that as we move forward and have a more solidified definition of Sense of Belonging as a goal.

The group then described the wide variation in **environmental connection** among Gulf communities — from small rural towns with direct ocean dependence to larger urban areas with weaker ties. A **scale** (e.g., 0 to 10) was proposed to measure connection to place and species, with examples such as Loreto’s link to tourism and blue whales versus communities more focused on fishing and food.  

**Cultural anthropology perspectives** on territory and access were introduced, and the group explored possible indicators, such as:

- **environmental education programs**, 
- **activism**, and 
- **access to public spaces** 

to measure the Sense of Belonging in the Gulf of California. 

Concerns were raised about **indigenous access rights,** and the difficulties of using "rights" as a proxy, as there are some groups that do not have territorial rights despite being a significant cultural and community group.

The North American *place-based education* framework was also highlighted as **very different** from the GoCA regional way to define connections between people and nature, and this should be kept in mind as we move forward.

The group agreed that belonging is closely tied to identity and **memories rooted in a territory.** 

* Based on this input, they decided the goal should focus on **defining and measuring belonging** across the Gulf’s diverse communities. To better reflect this focus, the goal’s name was changed from “Sense of Place” to **“Sense of Belonging”.**

### <i class="fa fa-step-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> Next steps 

- [ ] Review the [SB introduction slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/169YPUcF8fLgdq41xPMiUorCxNoTo3be0NIefNLF_Egw/edit?slide=id.g3702978bd0b_0_539#slide=id.g3702978bd0b_0_539) to revisit the main ideas.  
- [ ] Review the [Key Questions](#key-questions) and keep brainstorming.  
- [ ] Add your thoughts, ideas, and potential data sources to the ongoing [collaborative SP Model Notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWyrU_Ty38a4IMTRpzMMrrSGTjv_pPqvX2ICKJ8Gupo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8562cdkt8tdh).
  - [ ] Add recommended papers on **territory and access** to this shared google document.  

More topics to think about before our **next meeting**:

- What is the *ideal sense of belonging* for the Gulf of California?
- What could be potential **indicators** for measuring sense of belonging (e.g., education, activism, access, governance factors)?
- What are potential **reference points** for the Sense of Belonging goal?

Thank you all and see you next meeting (see the [SB Goalkeeper Group Information: who, what, when, where, why!](#admin-info) tab at the top of the page for more information)!

## Key Questions {#key-questions}

What does **sense of place, or belonging,** mean to all of you? Does the global definition of the goal, and its subgoals, make sense for the Gulf of California? 

If so, here are some questions for each subgoal:

#### **Iconic Species subgoal**

How can we identify **species** that are relevant to **local cultural identity** through:

1. Traditional activities (fishing, hunting, commerce)
2. Local ethnic or religious practices
3. Existence value
4. Locally-recognized aesthetic value (tourism, art subjects)
  
Are there publications about these types of species, or would all of you like to work together to **create a list** of the species that are iconic to the Gulf?

#### **Lasting Special Places subgoal**

How can we identify places or areas that are relevant to local cultural identity through:

1. Aesthetic, 
2. Spiritual,
3. Cultural,
4. Recreational,
5. Existence reasons, 
6. and more?

And, how do we define their **condition**? How will we quantify when this subgoal is doing really well (100/100)? Could it be:

* How well *protected* all of these special places are?
* How well they are *preserved*?
* How much funding is going towards them?
* How many people care about these places?

## Regional Considerations

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group (EWG).**

### Proposed iconic species 

Some species mentioned within the meeting:

- Almejas chocolata
- Yellowtail
- Swordfish
- Dorado (Mahi-Mahi)
- Roosterfish
- Totoaba
- Shrimp
- Pajaritos fish
- Whale sharks
- Sea lions
- Vaquita
- Saguaro cactus
- La Tijereta (Magnificent Frigatebird)

### Proposed proxies for LSP

Some proxies mentioned included actions that indicate community involvement:

-   Activism and campaigns: *Territory defense movements, environmental campaigns*
-   Environmental defenders: *Documentation of people killed defending areas*
-   Legal documentation: *Human rights activism records*
-   Territorial rights: *Indigenous territorial rights, cooperative concessions*

As well as physical places that are associated with cultural connections:

-   Protection status: *Local/state/federal protection levels (positive or negative impact)*
-   Public spaces: *Malecones (waterfront promenades), miradores (viewpoints)*
-   Traditional activities: *Cooperative fishing, diving areas*
-   Educational programs: *Environmental education initiatives*
-   Cultural heritage: *Islands with cultural significance*

**The EWG noted that a bottom-up approach is needed!** This is because:

-   Sense of belonging varies between communities
-   Gulf of California differs significantly from US contexts
-   Local definitions of "enjoyment" and "special places" should not be prescribed
