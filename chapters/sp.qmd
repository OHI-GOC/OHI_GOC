# OHI GoCA Goal Definition

The objective of the Sense of Belonging goal is to determine **how well we are caring and promoting** the heritage, shared memories, and identity that connect Gulf of California communities, including pueblos originarios, to their marine and coastal spaces: indicating how strongly people are rooted and included in the Gulf’s past, present, and future.

# <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>  Background Information on the SB Goal

**This goal measures human connections to the marine environment that provide a deep sense of identity and belonging.**

Feelings of identity and belonging stem from – for example:

-   Sense of identity within a community
-   Connection(s) to place(s)
-   Connections to plants and animals

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITIONS**

In the global framework, these are the definitions of the goal and subgoals (Iconic Species, and Lasting Special Places):

**Sense of Place (Goal)**

*Definition*: Captures aspects of coastal and marine systems that people value as part of their cultural identity.  There was a proposed alternative name: "Sense of belonging" *(suggested by Marlu)*

**Iconic Species (Subgoal)**

*Definition*: Species relevant to local cultural identity through traditional activities (fishing, hunting, commerce), local ethnic or religious practices, existence value, and locally-recognized aesthetic value (tourism, art subjects).

**Lasting Special Places (Subgoal)**

*Definition*: Geographic locations with particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational, or existence reasons.  These areas are then assessed by their protection levels/status for these valued locations.
:::

## Key Questions

What does **sense of place, or belonging,** mean to all of you? Does the global definition of the goal, and its subgoals, make sense for the Gulf of California? 

If so, here are some questions for each subgoal:

#### **Iconic Species subgoal**

How can we identify **species** that are relevant to **local cultural identity** through:

1. Traditional activities (fishing, hunting, commerce)
2. Local ethnic or religious practices
3. Existence value
4. Locally-recognized aesthetic value (tourism, art subjects)
  
Are there publications about these types of species, or would all of you like to work together to **create a list** of the species that are iconic to the Gulf?

#### **Lasting Special Places subgoal**

How can we identify places or areas that are relevant to local cultural identity through:

1. Aesthetic, 
2. Spiritual,
3. Cultural,
4. Recreational,
5. Existence reasons, 
6. and more?

And, how do we define their **condition**? How will we quantify when this subgoal is doing really well (100/100)? Could it be:

* How well *protected* all of these special places are?
* How well they are *preserved*?
* How much funding is going towards them?
* How many people care about these places?

### **Meeting Summaries**


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #1:** Introduction to OHI and Sense of Belonging

**Thank you for joining our first Sense of Belonging (SB) Goalkeeper meeting!**  
It was a great start to our work together in defining what sense of belonging and place means for the **Gulf of California**, and how it should be integrated into this assessment.  

::: {.callout-tip}

### {{< fa book >}} **Meeting Recap**

During our discussion, experts of the group emphasized the importance of artisanal fishing communities and their **multi-generational ties to the sea**, and that the sense of belonging has a big connection to both past and future generations. 

- While it was noted that artisanal fishing already has its own goal, it was then discussed whether identity- and community-based aspects should be incorporated separately.  We will likely define that as we move forward and have a more solidified definition of Sense of Belonging as a goal.

The group then described the wide variation in **environmental connection** among Gulf communities — from small rural towns with direct ocean dependence to larger urban areas with weaker ties. A **scale** (e.g., 0 to 10) was proposed to measure connection to place and species, with examples such as Loreto’s link to tourism and blue whales versus communities more focused on fishing and food.  

**Cultural anthropology perspectives** on territory and access were introduced, and the group explored possible indicators, such as:

- **environmental education programs**, 
- **activism**, and 
- **access to public spaces** 

to measure the Sense of Belonging in the Gulf of California. 

Concerns were raised about **indigenous access rights,** and the difficulties of using "rights" as a proxy, as there are some groups that do not have territorial rights despite being a significant cultural and community group.

The North American *place-based education* framework was also highlighted as **very different** from the GoCA regional way to define connections between people and nature, and this should be kept in mind as we move forward.

The group agreed that belonging is closely tied to identity and **memories rooted in a territory.** 

* Based on this input, they decided the goal should focus on **defining and measuring belonging** across the Gulf’s diverse communities. To better reflect this focus, the goal’s name was changed from “Sense of Place” to **“Sense of Belonging”.**

# <i class="fa-regular fa-clipboard"></i> **Meeting #2:** SB Goal Definition & Possible Subgoals 

**Thank you for joining our second Sense of Belonging (SB) Goalkeeper meeting!**  
This was such a fruitful discussion on the definition of Sense of Belonging, the possible ways to measure the goal, and based on that, the possible subgoals to be associated with this goal.  

We started this meeting by solidifying the general definition for the Sense of Belonging goal.  It is as follows:

::: custom-box

The objective of the Sense of Belonging goal is to determine **how well we are caring and promoting** the heritage, shared memories, and identity that connect Gulf of California communities, including pueblos originarios, to their marine and coastal spaces: indicating how strongly people are rooted and included in the Gulf’s past, present, and future.

:::


### What is Important to Measure in Sense of Belonging

Next, the group discussed indicators that could reflect how strongly Gulf of California communities feel rooted in and connected to their coasts. Four main themes emerged:

- **Coastal Access (CA)**  
  Public beach access and the availability of paths, roads, and parking. Repeat exposure to the ocean builds pride and stewardship.

- **Coastal Protection (CP)**
  How well culturally important Gulf-specific sites and legally protected areas are managed and preserved.

- **Coastal Culture (CC)**  
  Presence and condition of cultural organizations, events, NGO funding, educational programs related to the Gulf, and activism movements.  Additionally, the presence and condition of public spaces (malecónes, overlooks), and iconic landmarks (e.g., Cabo arch) that sustain community identity.

- **Iconic Species (IS)**  
  The status of culturally significant or symbolic species (e.g., vaquita, clams, whales, sea lions) that contribute to identity, tradition, and tourism.


### Group Discussion Highlights

During the discussion, participants emphasized how these indicators could be adapted to the Gulf’s unique contexts:

- **Ana Figueroa** highlighted the importance of recognizing **pueblos originarios** in the definition of Sense of Belonging, and noted that Mexico has several **legal instruments** that already protect species and habitats, even outside of formal protected areas. For example, the **NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010** identifies species at risk and sets conservation criteria, while the **Ley General de Vida Silvestre** establishes the national framework for sustainable use and protection of wildlife and their habitats. Other **normas** provide safeguards for particular species, such as marine turtles. Ana suggested layering these diverse conservation instruments to capture a fuller picture of coastal and cultural protection in the Gulf. She also pointed to the **acuerdos de destino**, concessions that grant authority over sections of the Federal Maritime Terrestrial Zone (*Zona Federal Marítimo Terrestre*) to government agencies (e.g., CONANP) for conservation purposes. While these instruments are unevenly applied and sometimes controversial, they still represent another way belonging and stewardship are exercised through law.  

  Ana cautioned that community movements often persist without formal funding, and that mapping the growth of NGOs and local groups over decades might be a stronger indicator than financial measures alone.

- **Marlu Robledo** emphasized the role of **territory defenders, youth collectives, and educational programs** in sustaining belonging. She and Ana both stressed that over-relying on financial metrics risks ignoring the social and cultural resources that communities contribute. Marlu offered to share research on **community philanthropy**, which shows that local contributions often outweigh foundation support.

- **Víctor Ricárdez** underscored the role of **territorial rights and ancestral lands**, pointing to examples like the Seri and Yaqui territories, as well as community-led restoration and conservation projects. He stressed that sense of belonging is deeply tied to these cultural-geographic identities, which should be visible in how indicators are defined.

- **Amy Hudson Weaver** suggested broadening **Coastal Protection** to include **fishing refuges and concessions** created by cooperatives, which foster stewardship and place-based identity. She also proposed tracking **community defense movements** (e.g., resisting extractive industries) as a reflection of belonging, and raised demographic dynamics (such as immigration and emigration) as factors influencing identity and community connection.

- **Rick Brusca** had an integral part in creating the four possible indicators presented earlier (CA, CP, etc).  He also proposed an additional indicator: the **proportion of a community directly dependent on the coast for their livelihoods** (e.g., fishing, tourism). He argued this economic reliance often signals a strong cultural connection to the sea.

Together, these insights enriched the four initial themes by adding nuance around **legal frameworks, territorial rights, community movements, and social change** as essential components of belonging in the Gulf of California.


### Using these ideas to define subgoals

From the discussion, all four example themes (**Coastal Access, Coastal Protection, Coastal Culture, and Iconic Species**) are important to integrate into the Sense of Belonging goal. In the next meeting, I will be presenting a possible way to integrate all of these ideas into specific subgoals, which we will discuss and solidify as a group.  

For context, these subgoals will each have their own indicators and score, which will then be averaged (simple or weighted) into one score for Sense of Belonging for each OHI GoCA region. 

Though this may change before the next meeting, the OHI team felt the themes might fit into three subgoals. Here are our preliminary thoughts for each:

##### **Lasting Special Places**

The condition or protection of locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational, or existence reasons. This subgoal combines elements of *Coastal Protection* and *Coastal Culture*, since special places are both culturally significant and ecologically valuable.

First, the "special places" need to be identified. Based on this meeting, here is a preliminary list:

* Iconic landmarks and public spaces 
* Concessions  
  * Government-led concessions (e.g., acuerdos de destino)  
  * Community-led concessions (fishing refuges, cooperative fishing concessions/TURFs)  
  * Indigenous territorial rights (as raised by Víctor: Seri, Yaqui, Cucapá)  
* Special habitats protected by normas or leys  
* Areas where restoration projects or large movements are taking place — the idea being that places with strong community mobilization likely reflect a high sense of belonging.  
* The spatial coverage of NGO involvement and capacity in marine and coastal areas.  

The OHI Core Team thinks it would be best to have a meeting devoted to identifying both cultural and ecological special places in the Gulf, so that areas that are important but not yet protected or well-managed can be highlighted by this goal. A follow-up meeting may then be needed to discuss each special place’s condition or level of protection.  

##### **Iconic Species**

The condition of iconic species that are relevant to local cultural identity.  

Typically, this subgoal starts by first creating a list of the iconic species and identifying which regions they belong to. Stock or local assessments (such as the [N-gen long-term study](https://nextgensd.com/gocecologicalhealth/) of species and their trends) can then be used to evaluate their condition.  

For each region, the *average status* of all iconic species can be calculated. The reference point could then be defined as maintaining or improving the condition of these species in each region over time.  

We will discuss this more in Meeting #3. In the meantime, if you have any ideas, please send an email to me or place them in the [SB Goalkeeper Idea document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWyrU_Ty38a4IMTRpzMMrrSGTjv_pPqvX2ICKJ8Gupo/edit?tab=t.kyrkgpt50url).  

##### **Community Involvement**

The number and vitality of educational programs, cultural organizations, cultural events, and activism campaigns all demonstrate collective action and stewardship capacity in each region. Together, these can serve as indicators of community involvement.  

This subgoal could incorporate *Coastal Access* as a multiplier: even with strong activism and programs, limited access to the coast weakens people’s ability to connect with marine and coastal areas.  

---

*Although we are not yet focusing on pressures and resiliences, the OHI Core Team noted that immigration and emigration dynamics, as raised by Amy Hudson Weaver, could act as an important pressure on the Sense of Belonging goal.*

### Additional Insights & Examples

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Expert Working Group (EWG): Regional Considerations

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group (EWG).**

### Proposed iconic species 

Some species mentioned within the meeting:

- Almejas chocolata
- Yellowtail
- Swordfish
- Dorado (Mahi-Mahi)
- Roosterfish
- Totoaba
- Shrimp
- Pajaritos fish
- Whale sharks
- Sea lions
- Vaquita
- Saguaro cactus
- La Tijereta (Magnificent Frigatebird)

### Proposed proxies for LSP

Some proxies mentioned included actions that indicate community involvement:

-   Activism and campaigns: *Territory defense movements, environmental campaigns*
-   Environmental defenders: *Documentation of people killed defending areas*
-   Legal documentation: *Human rights activism records*
-   Territorial rights: *Indigenous territorial rights, cooperative concessions*

As well as physical places that are associated with cultural connections:

-   Protection status: *Local/state/federal protection levels (positive or negative impact)*
-   Public spaces: *Malecones (waterfront promenades), miradores (viewpoints)*
-   Traditional activities: *Cooperative fishing, diving areas*
-   Educational programs: *Environmental education initiatives*
-   Cultural heritage: *Islands with cultural significance*

**The EWG noted that a bottom-up approach is needed!** This is because:

-   Sense of belonging varies between communities
-   Gulf of California differs significantly from US contexts
-   Local definitions of "enjoyment" and "special places" should not be prescribed
