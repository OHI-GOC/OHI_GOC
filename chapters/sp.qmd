It will appear under "Other calendars" and provide access to all scheduled meetings with updated Zoom links.

**Please let us know if you have any questions. We look forward to working on this initiative with you!**
:::

**This goal measures human connections to the marine environment that provide a deep sense of identity and belonging.**

Feelings of identity and belonging stem from – for example:

-   Sense of identity within a community
-   Connection(s) to place(s)
-   Connections to plants and animals

{{< fa lightbulb >}} **CORE DEFINITIONS**

In the global framework, these are the definitions of the goal and subgoals (Iconic Species, and Lasting Special Places):

**Sense of Place (Goal)**

*Definition*: Captures aspects of coastal and marine systems that people value as part of their cultural identity.  There was a proposed alternative name: "Sense of belonging" *(suggested by Marlu)*

**Iconic Species (Subgoal)**

*Definition*: Species relevant to local cultural identity through traditional activities (fishing, hunting, commerce), local ethnic or religious practices, existence value, and locally-recognized aesthetic value (tourism, art subjects).

**Lasting Special Places (Subgoal)**

*Definition*: Geographic locations with particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational, or existence reasons.  These areas are then assessed by their protection levels/status for these valued locations.
:::

## Key Questions

What does **sense of place, or belonging,** mean to all of you? Does the global definition of the goal, and its subgoals, make sense for the Gulf of California? 

If so, here are some questions for each subgoal:

#### **Iconic Species subgoal**

How can we identify **species** that are relevant to **local cultural identity** through:

1. Traditional activities (fishing, hunting, commerce)
2. Local ethnic or religious practices
3. Existence value
4. Locally-recognized aesthetic value (tourism, art subjects)
  
Are there publications about these types of species, or would all of you like to work together to **create a list** of the species that are iconic to the Gulf?

#### **Lasting Special Places subgoal**

How can we identify places or areas that are relevant to local cultural identity through:

1. Aesthetic, 
2. Spiritual,
3. Cultural,
4. Recreational,
5. Existence reasons, 
6. and more?

And, how do we define their **condition**? How will we quantify when this subgoal is doing really well (100/100)? Could it be:

* How well *protected* all of these special places are?
* How well they are *preserved*?
* How much funding is going towards them?
* How many people care about these places?

## Regional Considerations

**These are some of the points discussed by the Expert Working Group (EWG).**

### Proposed iconic species 

Some species mentioned within the meeting:

- Almejas chocolata
- Yellowtail
- Swordfish
- Dorado (Mahi-Mahi)
- Roosterfish
- Totoaba
- Shrimp
- Pajaritos fish
- Whale sharks
- Sea lions
- Vaquita
- Saguaro cactus
- La Tijereta (Magnificent Frigatebird)

### Proposed proxies for LSP

Some proxies mentioned included actions that indicate community involvement:

-   Activism and campaigns: *Territory defense movements, environmental campaigns*
-   Environmental defenders: *Documentation of people killed defending areas*
-   Legal documentation: *Human rights activism records*
-   Territorial rights: *Indigenous territorial rights, cooperative concessions*

As well as physical places that are associated with cultural connections:

-   Protection status: *Local/state/federal protection levels (positive or negative impact)*
-   Public spaces: *Malecones (waterfront promenades), miradores (viewpoints)*
-   Traditional activities: *Cooperative fishing, diving areas*
-   Educational programs: *Environmental education initiatives*
-   Cultural heritage: *Islands with cultural significance*

**The EWG noted that a bottom-up approach is needed!** This is because:

-   Sense of belonging varies between communities
-   Gulf of California differs significantly from US contexts
-   Local definitions of "enjoyment" and "special places" should not be prescribed
