The internal boundary is wider on the Sonora side so it includes San Esteban, Tiburon, Tuner/or Datil, and San Pedro Martir Islands.\n\nCentral Gulf (subregions 3 & 7). The Baja side (subregion 3) goes from the Baja Sur state border to just north of Loreto. The Sonoran side goes from El Choyudo to the Sonora/Sinaloa state border. \n\nSouthern Gulf (subregions 4, 8, 9). The Baja side (subregion 4) goes from just north of Loreto to Cabo San Lucas.

We can adjust this if it is problematic.\n- Does the midline boundaries seem reasonable?\n\n\n\n\n## OHI Subregions\n\nKey modifications made to POEM Areas: \n\n(1) POEM Area #92 was split at the Sinaloa-Nayarit state border, \n(2) POEM Area #112 was split to better align with Region_3 and Region_4, and \n(3) an additional area was added from the edge of the POEM Areas #107, #106, and #6 to Cabo Corrientes to establish the consensus southern boundary of Region_9.\n\n\n\n## Thank you all for your time! ¡Gracias a todos por su tiempo!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nHola a todos, ¡esperamos que todos estén bien!\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n## Abra esta pestaña para español :)\n\nHola a todos, ¡esperamos que todos estén bien!\n\n### ¡Por favor, dinos qué piensas!
