For example, millions of marine ornamental (aquarium) fish are harvested and exported for sale each year. This trade can provide a valuable and long-term income stream for low-income coastal communities if undertaken in a sustainable manner.\n\nFor the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region, this score is driven almost entirely by the fish oil/fish meal trade. The one exception is that ornamental fish trade comprises about 18% of Israel's Natural Product score, the rest of the countries have very little (i.e., < 1% of score) or no ornamental fish trade.\n\n## Scores\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nsource(\"../_data/functions/start_script.R\")\nsource(\"../_data/functions/score_display_functions.R\")\nscore <- score(x=\"NP\", ohi_scores)\n\n```\n\n:::: {.columns} \n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n**The Natural Products score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was `r score`.**\n\n<span style=\"color: gray;\">The scores in this region are fairly high.

This goal does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not sustainable. Ideally targets are based on the amount of harvest that does not threaten future harvest, such as the maximum sustainable yield from fisheries stock status scores.\n\nCurrently, the global Ocean Health Index includes harvest and production of non-food seaweed, ornamental fish, and wild-caught fish used for fish oil and meal.\n\nA high score indicates that natural resources are maximally harvested at a rate that does not threaten future harvest and minimizes ecological harm.\n\n## A closer look at the data\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n## Other components of an OHI score: Pressures, resilience, and trend\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the *current status* dimension of the score, but *pressures*, *resilience*, and *past trends* are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the *current status* score.  \n\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment. \n\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure). \n\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.    \nWe provide a brief description of all the [pressure](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/pressures.html) and [resilience](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/resilience.html) variables along with how they affect each goal.
