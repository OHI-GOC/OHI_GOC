A tentative timeline is provided above, and the corresponding Google spreadsheet may be edited [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sVkjg_hJ6f-SXedLJ-gqXmPpEVWXcPvnY83pIH9HRCo/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (contact Melanie at frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu for access).\n\n**Defining spatial boundaries**\nThe boundaries of the assessment area must be determined. This [document](https://ohi-goc.github.io/ohi_goc_prep/spatial/ohi_goc_spatial_prep.html) explains some of the issues.\n\nThe Gulf of California could be considered one region for this assessment, or it could be divided into smaller subregions to allow for comparisons among political or ecological regions. The boundaries are important to develop early on because data will be collected at this spatial scale.\n\n**Establish Goals**\nThe goal framework will need to be established. The 10 goals originally selected for the global assessment can help guide the goals chosen for the Gulf of California assessment. \n\n![](figs/conceptual_framework.jpg)\n\nWhen tailoring the OHI framework it is important to understand the rationale behind previously-developed approaches and to reflect whether any goals should be added, removed, or redefined. The best way to begin is by exploring the philosophy underlying each of the original goals, and then working from there. The menu to the left provides a brief description of each of the goals used in the global model as  well as  a description of how other regional indices have adapted the goal to fit their needs. \n\nThese goal pages will be updated over time to reflect the specific needs of the Gulf of California.\n\n**Identify Pressures and Resilience**\nAlong with the goals, it is equally important to define and categorize how local pressures and resilience properties affect the goals. We will provide more guidance on that later, but in the meantime, you can learn more about [pressures](https://oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/pressure/) and [resilience](https://oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/resilience/). \n\n**Identify Goal Keepers**\nAfter the goals are established, it will be necessary to identify 3-5 people who will serve as subject matter experts for each goal. These \"Goalies\" will help develop goal models, identify potential data, and establish reference points. \n\nThey will work closely with the Expert Working Group and OHI analysts to develop and test the goals.\n\nGoogle spreadsheet for [Goalies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkYMNljpDPmBoQuPOP9fkW2gKXPsiJJyw9Li09Xl8xM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (contact Melanie, frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu for access).\n\n### Phase 3: Conduct\nDuring this stage, the expert working group, goal specific experts, and analysts will work closely to further refine the OHI framework, identify data, and calculate and review scores. This is an iterative process and this [resource](https://ohi-science.org/toolbox-training/) includes detailed methods for conducting an OHI assessment.   \n\n### Phase 4: Inform\nThis phase involves developing and implementing a strategy for using the OHI assessment to improve the marine health of the Gulf of California.  This is most effective if there is interest and engagement from policy makers and ongoing communication during the OHI process to best inform management actions that could have measurable impacts. Repeated assessments as new data become available enable tracking ocean health through time and evaluating management priorities.
