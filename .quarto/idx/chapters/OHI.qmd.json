In particular, it will be useful to become familiar with each of the 10 [goals](https://oceanhealthindex.org/goals/). The website also includes useful information about embarking on a [regional OHI assessment](https://oceanhealthindex.org/ohi+/conduct/).\n\n\n**Nail down timeline**\nIdentify key deadlines and meeting times. A tentative timeline is provided above, and the corresponding Google spreadsheet can be edited [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sVkjg_hJ6f-SXedLJ-gqXmPpEVWXcPvnY83pIH9HRCo/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (contact Melanie at frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu for access).\n\n**Defining spatial boundaries**\nSeveral decisions will need to be made concerning the boundaries of the assessment. This [document](https://ohi-goc.github.io/ohi_goc_prep/spatial/ohi_goc_spatial_prep.html) explains some of the issues. \n\n**Framework: Goals**\nThe goal framework will need to be established. This will involve determining whether goals should cut or added. Goal models should also be evaluated to determine how they can be improved to meet the needs of the region. It will also be necessary to consider reference points!\n\nThe best way to approach this is to explore the philosophy underlying each goal. The [OHI global website](https://oceanhealthindex.org/goals/) provides a brief description of each goal and each goal page includes a link to **PRACTICAL GUIDANCE** which provides specific advice and a description of how other regional indices have adapted the goal to fit their needs. \n\nIt is also worth navigating the menu bar to your left to learn about the goals. These will be updated over time to be more specific to the Gulf of California.\n\n**Framework: Pressures and Resilience**\nThe pressures and resilience metrics will also need to be established. We will provide more guidance on that later, but in the meantime, you can learn more about [pressure](https://oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/pressure/) and [resilience](https://oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/resilience/) metrics. \n\n**Identify Goal Keepers**\nAfter the goals are established, it will be necessary to identify 3-5 subject matter experts to work on each goal. These \"Goalies\" will help develop goal models, identify potential data, and establish reference points. \n\nThey will work closely with the Expert Working Group to develop and test the goals.\n\nGoogle spreadsheet for [Goalies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkYMNljpDPmBoQuPOP9fkW2gKXPsiJJyw9Li09Xl8xM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (contact Melanie, frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu for access).\n\n### Phase 3: Score calculation\nMore to come!!!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n<img src=\"figs/shoreline.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\n## Starting an OHI assessment!\n\nWelcome!
