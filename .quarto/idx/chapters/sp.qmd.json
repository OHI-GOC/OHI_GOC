Additional culturally important species species, available at the continent level (Garcia et al. 2023), were added to supplement the original iconic species list. \n\n\n### Lasting special places\nThe Lasting special places sub-goal measures how well we are protecting, for current and future generations, the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity.\n\nSpecial places are coastal and marine areas that are culturally significant for a variety of reasons. Designating a place to be a landmark, monument, and/or Marine Protected Area can help ensure its existence, provide valuable ecosystem services and preserve cultural heritage and identity.\n\nTo get a score of 100 a region must protect at least 30% of its coastal area. \n\nWe use the United Nation’s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) to identify protected areas. The WDPA aggregates several key databases: IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas, Global Marine Protected Areas, UNESCO World Heritage Marine sites, National Parks and Nature Reserves, and the United Nations List of Protected Places.  In most cases the year of designation is listed for each protected area.\n\nWe focus only on coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) for marine special places because we assume lasting special places are primarily in coastal areas. For coastlines, we focus only on the first 1-km-wide strip of land as a way to increase the likelihood that the area being protected by terrestrial parks is connected to the marine system in some way.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n## More details (click to expand)\n\nThe lasting special places sub-goal focuses on geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons. This sub-goal is particularly hard to quantify. Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed). The reality is that such lists do not exist. Instead, we assume areas that are protected indicate special places (i.e., the effort to protect them suggests they are important places). Clearly this is an imperfect assumption but in many cases it will be true.\n:::\n\n## A closer look at the data\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n## Other components of an OHI score: Pressures, resilience, and trend\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the *current status* dimension of the score, but *pressures*, *resilience*, and *past trends* are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the *current status* score.  \n\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment. \n\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure). \n\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.    \nWe provide a brief description of all the [pressure](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/pressures.html) and [resilience](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/resilience.html) variables along with how they affect each goal. A brief description of how these variables are incorporated into the final score is [here](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/rstudio/p/56fe4d6c/chapters/OHI.html#how-are-ohi-scores-calculated). \n::: \n\n### Current status\n\nWe will first look at the data underlying the Iconic species subgoal and then the Lasting special places subgoal. \n\n#### Iconic species\nThe following is a list of iconic species found in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region as well as their IUCN conservation status. Iconic species include animals such as the Blue Whale (endangered), Grey Reef Shark (endangered), Blacktip Reef Shark (vulnerable), and the Humphead Wrasse (endangered). \n\nWe identified 24 iconic species within the region. For each species we determine the IUCN threatened status designations within each region the species is located. In 52 (of N=141) cases, the species were critically endangered or endangered; 45 were vulnerable, and 34 were either of least concern or not threatened.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n## Iconic species condition scores (click to expand)\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\ngoal <- \"ico\"\nrsga_rgns <- read_csv(here(\"_data/output/rsga_ohi_rgns.csv\"))\n\n# list of OHI datafiles:\nico_files <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/c6e3408366c2d6e3b2cd42b0c80e1c39e2ffe43b/metadata_documentation/layers_eez_base.csv\") %>%\n  filter(str_detect(layer, goal)) \n\nico_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", ico_files$dir), ico_files$fn)) %>%\n  filter(year == 2022) \n\nico <- left_join(rsga_rgns, ico_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  select(iso3c, country = region_name, species = sciname, year = eval_yr, status = category) %>%\n  mutate(status = case_when(\n    status == \"CR\" ~ \"Critically threatened\",\n    status == \"EN\" ~ \"Endangered\",\n    status == \"LC\" ~ \"Least concern\",\n    status == \"NT\" ~ \"Not threatened\",\n    status == \"VU\" ~ \"Vulnerable\",\n    TRUE ~ status  # Keeps the original value if none of the above conditions are met\n  )) \n\n  datatable(ico,\n          options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE),\n          filter = 'top')\n\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n#### Lasting special places\nThese data describe the km2 and percent protected areas located in the 1km inland coastal areas and 3nm offshore regions. \n\nIn regard to protected areas, only Saudi Arabia (~ 12% protected), Israel (~4%), and Egypt (~21%) have marine protected areas along the coastline and offshore regions (within 3nm of the coast), but none are near the 30% required to obtain a score of 100. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n## Protected areas: Country data (click to expand)\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\ngoal <- \"lsp_\"\nrsga_rgns <- read_csv(here(\"_data/output/rsga_ohi_rgns.csv\"))\n\n# list of OHI datafiles:\ndatafiles <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/c6e3408366c2d6e3b2cd42b0c80e1c39e2ffe43b/metadata_documentation/layers_eez_base.csv\") \n\ninland_mpa <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"lsp_prot_area_inland1km\") \ninland_mpa_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\", gsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", inland_mpa$dir), inland_mpa$fn)) %>%\n  filter(year==2022)\n\nmarine_mpa <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm\") \nmarine_mpa_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", marine_mpa$dir), marine_mpa$fn)) %>%\n  filter(year==2022)\n\nmarine_area <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"rgn_area_offshore3nm\") \nmarine_area_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", marine_area$dir), marine_area$fn)) %>%\n  select(rgn_id, marine_area=area)\n\ninland_area <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"rgn_area_inland1km\") \ninland_area_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", inland_area$dir), inland_area$fn)) %>%\n  select(rgn_id, inland_area=area)\n\nlsp <- left_join(rsga_rgns, marine_mpa_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  left_join(marine_area_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  mutate(marine_proportion = round(a_prot_3nm/marine_area*100, 0)) %>%\n  left_join(inland_mpa_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  left_join(inland_area_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  mutate(coastal_proportion = round(a_prot_1km/inland_area*100, 0)) %>%\n  select(iso3c, region_name, km2_protected_marine=a_prot_3nm, percent_marine=marine_proportion, km2_protected_coast = a_prot_1km, percent_coast = coastal_proportion)\n\n\n  datatable(lsp,\n          options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE),\n          filter = 'top')\n\n\n```\n:::\n\n## Implications\n\nOverall, more could be done to protect the species and areas that people value in this region.\n\nIconic species scores are fairly low throughout the region, indicating that the welfare of many iconic species, such as the Blue Whale and Green Sea Turtle, is threatened.\n\nFurthermore, according to the global data, there are very few Marine Protected Areas in the region.

In 52 (of N=141) cases, the species were critically endangered or endangered; 45 were vulnerable, and 34 were either of least concern or not threatened.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n## Iconic species condition scores (click to expand)\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\ngoal <- \"ico\"\nrsga_rgns <- read_csv(here(\"_data/output/rsga_ohi_rgns.csv\"))\n\n# list of OHI datafiles:\nico_files <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/c6e3408366c2d6e3b2cd42b0c80e1c39e2ffe43b/metadata_documentation/layers_eez_base.csv\") %>%\n  filter(str_detect(layer, goal)) \n\nico_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", ico_files$dir), ico_files$fn)) %>%\n  filter(year == 2022) \n\nico <- left_join(rsga_rgns, ico_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  select(iso3c, country = region_name, species = sciname, year = eval_yr, status = category) %>%\n  mutate(status = case_when(\n    status == \"CR\" ~ \"Critically threatened\",\n    status == \"EN\" ~ \"Endangered\",\n    status == \"LC\" ~ \"Least concern\",\n    status == \"NT\" ~ \"Not threatened\",\n    status == \"VU\" ~ \"Vulnerable\",\n    TRUE ~ status  # Keeps the original value if none of the above conditions are met\n  )) \n\n  datatable(ico,\n          options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE),\n          filter = 'top')\n\n\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n#### Lasting special places\nThese data describe the km2 and percent protected areas located in the 1km inland coastal areas and 3nm offshore regions. \n\nIn regard to protected areas, only Saudi Arabia (~ 12% protected), Israel (~4%), and Egypt (~21%) have marine protected areas along the coastline and offshore regions (within 3nm of the coast), but none are near the 30% required to obtain a score of 100. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n## Protected areas: Country data (click to expand)\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\ngoal <- \"lsp_\"\nrsga_rgns <- read_csv(here(\"_data/output/rsga_ohi_rgns.csv\"))\n\n# list of OHI datafiles:\ndatafiles <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/c6e3408366c2d6e3b2cd42b0c80e1c39e2ffe43b/metadata_documentation/layers_eez_base.csv\") \n\ninland_mpa <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"lsp_prot_area_inland1km\") \ninland_mpa_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\", gsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", inland_mpa$dir), inland_mpa$fn)) %>%\n  filter(year==2022)\n\nmarine_mpa <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm\") \nmarine_mpa_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", marine_mpa$dir), marine_mpa$fn)) %>%\n  filter(year==2022)\n\nmarine_area <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"rgn_area_offshore3nm\") \nmarine_area_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", marine_area$dir), marine_area$fn)) %>%\n  select(rgn_id, marine_area=area)\n\ninland_area <- filter(datafiles, layer==\"rgn_area_inland1km\") \ninland_area_df  <- read_csv(file.path(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2023/gh-pages/\",\ngsub(\"ohiprep:\", \"\", inland_area$dir), inland_area$fn)) %>%\n  select(rgn_id, inland_area=area)\n\nlsp <- left_join(rsga_rgns, marine_mpa_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  left_join(marine_area_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  mutate(marine_proportion = round(a_prot_3nm/marine_area*100, 0)) %>%\n  left_join(inland_mpa_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  left_join(inland_area_df, by=\"rgn_id\") %>%\n  mutate(coastal_proportion = round(a_prot_1km/inland_area*100, 0)) %>%\n  select(iso3c, region_name, km2_protected_marine=a_prot_3nm, percent_marine=marine_proportion, km2_protected_coast = a_prot_1km, percent_coast = coastal_proportion)\n\n\n  datatable(lsp,\n          options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE),\n          filter = 'top')\n\n\n```\n:::\n\n## Implications\n\nOverall, more could be done to protect the species and areas that people value in this region.\n\nIconic species scores are fairly low throughout the region, indicating that the welfare of many iconic species, such as the Blue Whale and Green Sea Turtle, is threatened.\n\nFurthermore, according to the global data, there are very few Marine Protected Areas in the region. Implementing Marine Protected Areas along the coastline and nearshore areas in all the countries would immediately improve scores.\n\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised the [iconic species](https://oceanhealthindex.org/guidance/iconic-species/) and [lasting special places](https://oceanhealthindex.org/guidance/lasting-special-places/) subgoals to better reflect local concerns.
