For the global OHI assessment, regulatory effort is comprised of five categories that address the 5 pressure categories: fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution, and species introductions. There is also an additional category for goal-specific regulations that apply to a goal or goals, but do not address a specific pressure category.  \n\n\n**Social integrity**\n\n> Well functioning societies have the capacity and resources to mitigate a wide array of challenges.This indicator is intended to describe the effectiveness of social institutions that exist to meet human needs such as government, economy, education, heathcare, and religion.\n\n----\n\nEach resilience category may be composed of several datasets.
