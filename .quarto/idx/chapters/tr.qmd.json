We have not been able to incorporate domestic tourism, but we operate under the assumption that international arrivals capture the relative participation in tourist activities well enough. \n\nThis goal also incorporates a measure of sustainability from the World Economic Forum's Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI). \n\nThe reference point is relative to other countries, such that to get a score of 100, a country has to have rates of tourism that are better than (or equal to), 90% of countries.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n## More details (click to expand)\n\nThe model for the status of the tourism & recreation goal, $x_{tr}$, is:\n\n$$\nx_{tr} = \\frac{ T_r }{ T_{90th}}, (Eq. 6.20)\n$$\n\nwhere, $T_{90th}$ is the $T_r$ value of the region value that corresponds to the 90th quantile, and:  \n\n$$\nT_{r} = { A }\\times { S }, (Eq. 6.21)\n$$\n\nwhere, $A$ is the proportion of overnight tourist arrivals divided by the total international arrivals, and $S$ is sustainability. \n\nIdeally there would be data available specifically for arrivals, $A$, related to coastal tourism; however, the best data available at a global scale reports the total international arrivals, which does not solely reflect coastal tourism.\n\nUnfortunately it was not possible to determine the proportion of international arrivals affiliated with strictly leisure tourism. However, some (unknown) proportion of business travelers also enjoy the coast for leisure during their visit to coastal areas, such that we assumed all tourist arrivals were related to tourism and recreation values. Regional applications of the Index can make use of better-resolved data and more direct measures of tourism, as has been done within the US West Coast, where data for participation in coastal recreational activities across 19 different sectors were available.\n\nMeasures of sustainability are data from the World Economic Forum's Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI). This index measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable and resilient development of the Travel and Tourism (T&T) sector, which in turn contributes to the development of a country.” The index is comprised of five subindexes 17 pillars and 112 individual indicators, distributed among the different pillars. We use scores for the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex which encompasses three pillars:\n\n    \nPillar 15: **Environmental Sustainability**\n\n  * Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita\n  * Renewable energy\n  * Global Climate Risk Index\n  * Investment in green energy and infrastructure\n  * Particulate matter (2.5) concentration\n  * Baseline water stress\n  * Red List Index\n  * Forest cover loss\n  * Wastewater treatment\n  * Clean ocean water\n  * Number of environmental treaty ratifications\n  * Adequate protection for nature\n  * Oversight of production impact on the environment and nature\n  * Total protected areas coverage\n  * Average proportion of key bio\n    \nPillar 16: **Socioeconomic Resilience and Conditions**\n\n  * Poverty rate\n  * Social protection basic coverage\n  * Social protection spending\n  * Not in education, employment or training (NEET) ratio\n  * Equal workforce opportunities\n  * Workers’ rights\n  * Gender Inequality Index\n\nPillar 17: **Travel and Tourism Demand Pressure and Impact**\n\n  * T&T GDP multiplier\n  * Inbound length of stay\n  * Seasonality of international tourist arrivals\n  * Concentration of interest in cultural attractions\n  * Concentration of interest in nature attractions\n  * Geographically dispersed tourism\n  * Quality of town and city centre\n    \nThe sustainability factor, $S$, is the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex score, which is the unweighted average of its three component pillars. \n:::\n\n\n## A closer look at the data\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n## Other components of an OHI score: Pressures, resilience, and trend\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the *current status* dimension of the score, but *pressures*, *resilience*, and *past trends* are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the *current status* score.  \n\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment. \n\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure). \n\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.    \nWe provide a brief description of all the [pressure](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/pressures.html) and [resilience](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/resilience.html) variables along with how they affect each goal.

A score of 1 indicates that the vast majority of the people entering the country are remaining in the country as tourists. \n\nThe sustainability scores range from 1-7, but in reality, the observed county scores range from 3.1 to 5.3, with a mean of 4.2.
