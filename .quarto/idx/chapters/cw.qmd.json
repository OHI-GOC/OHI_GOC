However, in cases where a subcomponent was zero, we added a value of 0.01 (on a scale of 0 to 1) to prevent the overall score from going to zero.  Given that there is uncertainty around our pollution estimates, a zero score resulting from one subcomponent seemed too extreme.\n\nAlthough clean waters are relevant and important anywhere in the ocean, coastal waters drive this goal both because the problems of pollution are concentrated there and because people predominantly access and care about clean waters in coastal areas. The nearshore area is what people can see and where beach-going, shoreline fishing, and other activities occur. Furthermore, the data for high seas areas is limited and there is little meaningful regulation or governance over the input of pollution into these areas. We therefore calculate this goal only for the first 3 nm of ocean for each country’s EEZ. We chose 3 nm for several reasons, but found the status results to be relatively insensitive to different distances. \n:::\n\n## A closer look at the data\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n## Other components of an OHI score: Pressures, resilience, and trend\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the *current status* dimension of the score, but *pressures*, *resilience*, and *past trends* are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the *current status* score.  \n\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment. \n\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure). \n\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.    \nWe provide a brief description of all the [pressure](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/pressures.html) and [resilience](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/resilience.html) variables along with how they affect each goal.
