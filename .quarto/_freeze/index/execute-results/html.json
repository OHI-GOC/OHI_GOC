Researchers and stakeholders can come here to observe the process of creating the Gulf of California OHI, learn more about the OHI Gulf and California framework as it develops, and explore underlying data used to calculate the Index.      \n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## A short introduction to the Ocean Health Index\n<img src=\"chapters/figs/ocean_health_index2.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\n\n:::: {.columns} \n\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\nThe Ocean Health Index is a framework for assessing and communicating ocean health, or, how well we are managing ocean resources to sustainably deliver benefits to people now and in the future.\n\nSince itâ€™s inception in 2012, we have conducted 13 global assessments, and over [30 regional assessments](https://oceanhealthindex.org/ohi+/assessment/) have been conducted independently, or in partnership us.\n\nThe original global OHI assesses 10 goals, each of which is based on a marine service or function that humans directly care about, such as jobs and food. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"65%\"}\n\n![](chapters/figs/goals.jpg)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\nThe ten goals included in global assessments have been identified as widely-shared across different geographies, but they are not universal, and assessments using the OHI framework should only include goals that are relevant to their region. Most regional assessments modify the number and composition of the goals based on their specific needs. The goals that are ultimately included in the Gulf of California assessment will likely differ from the global assessment, because some goals may not be relevant to the region. Alternatively, new goals, not included in the global assessment, may be developed given a region's natural resources or priorities. \n\nIn addition to changes in the goal infrastructure, the model and data used to calculate the goals will  change because: \n \n - Higher quality local data is usually available!\n\n- Goal models, and reference points, can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region.  \n\n- Goals can be weighted differently based on regional priorities.\n\n\n### Goal calculations\nGoal scores are mainly determined by how well the goal is performing relative to an established target, we refer to this as the goal status score.\n\nIn addition to the status score, goal scores incorporate three additional metrics: pressures, resilience, and trend. The pressures acting on a goal will reduce its score, and can include climate change or human disturbance. The pressures acting on a goal can be mitigated by elements that contribute to the resilience of the system, such as good governance and protected areas. We also incorporate the recent trajectory of a goal's status into the final score, such that goals with improving status will have a better score, and goals with decreasing status will worsen the score.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## To learn more...\n\n- Navigate the menu at the left for more information about each goal. Overtime, these descriptions will be updated with information specific to the Gulf of California assessment.\n\n- The [oceanhealthindex.org](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) website is a good place to learn more about the OHI framework.\n\n- This [resource](https://oceanhealthindex.org/ohi+/conduct/learn/) provides a nice readable summary of the OHI.\n\n:::\n",
