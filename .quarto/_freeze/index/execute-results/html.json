Overtime, these descriptions will be updated with information specific to the Gulf of California assessment.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## To learn more about the Ocean Health Index...\n\n\n- The [oceanhealthindex.org](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) website is a good place to learn more about the OHI framework.\n\n- This [resource](https://oceanhealthindex.org/ohi+/conduct/learn/) provides a nice readable summary of the OHI.\n\n:::\n",
