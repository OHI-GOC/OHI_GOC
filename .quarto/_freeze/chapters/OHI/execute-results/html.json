Plus, they can be difficult to communicate because most people do not directly care about nutrient pollution, however, they do care about its effects on the ocean’s ability to provide recreation and food.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nThe OHI recognizes people are an important part of the marine system.\n\n:::\n\nThe OHI tracks both the *pressures* we put on oceans as well as the *benefits* we receive. Both conservation and extractive use of ocean resources are valued, and consequently, scores are highest when we maximize the benefits we receive while maintaining sustainability. Many indices focus only on the pressures that humans apply to systems, which makes sense because we want to be sure to adequately protect the ocean. However, eliminating all pressures on the ocean would require eliminating all contact between humans and the ocean. Beyond being unrealistic, this is undesirable because we would stop receiving all the benefits that we rely on from the ocean. \n\n\n## What is a goal?\n\nScientists, economists, and sociologists reviewed what people want and expect from the ocean and then grouped them into ten categories called ‘goals.’\n\n![](figs/goals.jpg)\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n\n## More about each of the goals (click to expand)\n\nClicking on the goal will link to the goal pages which provide more information about goals.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-fb0cf863d42afe6beaa0\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-fb0cf863d42afe6beaa0\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/ao.html\\\">Artisanal fishing opportunity<\\/a>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/bd.html\\\">Biodiversity<\\/a>\",null,null,\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/cs.html\\\">Carbon storage<\\/a>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/cw.html\\\">Clean waters<\\/a>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/cp.html\\\">Coastal protection<\\/a>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/fp.html\\\">Food provision<\\/a>\",null,null,\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/le.html\\\">Livelihoods & economies<\\/a>\",null,null,\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/np.html\\\">Natural products<\\/a>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/sp.html\\\">Sense of place<\\/a>\",null,null,\"<a href=\\\"https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/tr.html\\\">Tourism & recreation<\\/a>\"],[null,null,\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habitats\",\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Species\",null,null,null,null,\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fisheries\",\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mariculture\",null,\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Livelihoods\",\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economies\",null,null,\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iconic species\",\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasting special places\",null],[\"Access people have to coastal resources, whether or not they actually take fish or harvest from coastal waters.\",\"Conservation status of marine species.\",\"Condition of habitats that are important for supporting a wide array of species diversity.\",\"How successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained.\",\"Ability of natural coastal ecosystems to absorb and sequester carbon.\",\"Degree to which waters are unpolluted.\",\"Amount of current coastal protection provided by habitats relative to historic protection.\",\"Amount of seafood sustainably grown or harvested for human consumption, including wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational fisheries.\",\"Amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested, with sustainability defined by multi-species yield, and with penalties assigned for both over- and under-harvesting.\",\"Ability to obtain maximal seafood yield from farm facilities without damaging the ocean's ability to continue providing resources for people in the future.\",\"Maintainence of coastal and ocean-dependent livelihoods and economies.\",\"Benefits people obtain from the oceans in the form of quality jobs and wages.\",\"Economic value associated with marine industries.\",\"Sustainable harvest of marine resources.\",\"Level of protection provided for coastal and marine systems that contribute to cultural identity.\",\"Health of species that are important to local cultural identity.\",\"Conservation status of geographic locations that hold significant aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational, or existence value for people.\",\"Value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal areas.\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>goal<\\/th>\\n      <th>subgoal<\\/th>\\n      <th>description<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nEach goal is scored on the delivery of specific benefits with respect to a sustainable target. A goal is given a score of 100 if its benefits are maximized without compromising the ocean’s ability to deliver those benefits in the future. Lower scores indicate that more benefits could be gained or that current methods are harming the delivery of future benefits.\n\n\n## How are OHI scores calculated?\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Goal scores are the building blocks of the OHI score!\nTo obtain the overall OHI score for each region, the scores of the ten goals are averaged. The global assessment weights the goal scores equally, but some assessments may place different values on the goals, and thus, weight the goals differently.\n\n:::\n\nGoal scores are based on several components: current status, likely future status, trend, pressures, and resilience.\n\n**Current status** A goal's current value compared to its reference point, resulting in a score from 0 to 100.\n\n**Likely future status** The goal's predicted status score five years in the future (once again on a scale of 0 to 100), which is estimated by adjusting the current status score by three variables:\n\n- **Trend** observed change in goal's status during most recent 5 years.\n\n- **Pressures** ecological and social factors that decrease a goal's status. \n\n- **Resilience** ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc.) that mitigate the pressures acting on a goal. \n\n![](figs/methodology-chart.png)\nOnce each region has a goal and index score, these can be averaged (weighted by EEZ area) to obtain an overall score for the entire area of interest.\n\n## Why do an independent assessment?\nOHI+ assessments are conducted by independent groups to measure ocean health in their regions, countries, states, and communities. These assessments can be used by managers to incorporate local information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.\n\nIndependent assessments use the same framework as the global assessment, but can explore the variables influencing ocean health at the smaller scales where policy and management decisions are made. Goal models and targets are created using higher resolution data, indicators, and priorities, which produce scores better reflecting local realities. This enables scientists, managers, policy makers, and the public to better and more holistically understand, track, and communicate the status of local marine ecosystems, and to design strategic management actions to improve overall ocean health.\n\nAssessments provide an opportunity engage multiple stakeholders in a collaborative process. In our experiences engaging with various countries around the world, the process of conducting the assessment was just as valuable (if not more) than the final results. This is because the assessment process serves as a forum to engage stakeholders from multiple backgrounds (scientific, civil society, government, private sector, NGOs, etc.) to discuss local preferences and priorities, understand the interactions between various activities, and collaboratively establish management targets.\n\nConducting a local OHI+ assessment is also valuable because it results in a synthesized collection of data and scientific findings.\n",
