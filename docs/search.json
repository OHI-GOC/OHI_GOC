    "text": "A short introduction to the Ocean Health Index\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Health Index is a framework for assessing and communicating ocean health, or, how well we are managing ocean resources to sustainably deliver benefits to people now and in the future.\nSince it’s inception in 2012, we have conducted 13 global assessments, and over 30 regional assessments have been conducted independently, or in partnership us.\nThe original global OHI assesses 10 goals, each of which is based on a marine service or function that humans directly care about, such as jobs and food.\n\n\n\n\nThe ten goals included in global assessments have been identified as widely-shared across different geographies, but they are not universal, and assessments using the OHI framework should only include goals that are relevant to their region. Most regional assessments modify the number and composition of the goals based on their specific needs. The goals that are ultimately included in the Gulf of California assessment will likely differ from the global assessment, because some goals may not be relevant to the region. Alternatively, new goals, not included in the global assessment, may be developed given a region’s natural resources or priorities.\nIn addition to changes in the goal infrastructure, the model and data used to calculate the goals will change because:\n\nHigher quality local data is usually available!\nGoal models, and reference points, can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region.\nGoals can be weighted differently based on regional priorities.\n\n\nGoal calculations\nGoal scores are mainly determined by how well the goal is performing relative to an established target, we refer to this as the goal status score.\nIn addition to the status score, goal scores incorporate three additional metrics: pressures, resilience, and trend. The pressures acting on a goal will reduce its score, and can include climate change or human disturbance. The pressures acting on a goal can be mitigated by elements that contribute to the resilience of the system, such as good governance and protected areas. We also incorporate the recent trajectory of a goal’s status into the final score, such that goals with improving status will have a better score, and goals with decreasing status will worsen the score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more…\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the menu at the left for more information about each goal. Overtime, these descriptions will be updated with information specific to the Gulf of California assessment.\nThe oceanhealthindex.org website is a good place to learn more about the OHI framework.\nThis resource provides a nice readable summary of the OHI.",

    "text": "Artisanal fishing opportunities\nThis goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n This information is meant to help guide the process of developing the Gulf of California OHI!\nThis goal is included in the global OHI, but other regional assessments have cut or modified this goal to better meet their objectives for ocean health. For example, in a Canadian OHI assessment, the perspective of Aboriginal communities, which has been absent from assessments at the global scale due to lack of information, was represented by redefining the artisanal fishing opportunities goal as the Aboriginal opportunity goal. The model will almost certainly be modified for the Gulf of California assessment. For example, need is a component of the global analysis, but may not be relevant in a regional assessment.\n\n\nOverview\nArtisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, especially in developing nations. Small-scale fishing is an important component of cultural identity and heritage.\n\nHalf the world’s fish harvest is captured by artisanal fishing families.\n\nThis goal measures how easy or hard it is for fishers to access ocean resources when they need them and the sustainability of harvest of stocks used by artisanal fishers. The need for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line. Access, or ability to meet this need, are institutional permits or encouragements for small fisheries. Sustainability of artisanal fisheries refers to the sustainability of fishing methods and/or the health of targeted species. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing.\nA high score indicates that the demand for artisanal fishing is being met using lawful and sustainable methods, or alternatively, there is little economic need for artisanal fishing. A low score indicates that regions are not achieving or allowing sustainable artisanal fishing opportunities to be realized.\nWhile small-scale fishing provides benefits and opportunities for local communities, limited or ineffective regulation and enforcement can signficantly impact the ability to pursue it.\nComparison of large scale and small scale fisheries\n\n\n\nInfographic from Jacquet et al. 2008\n\n\n\n\nPractical Guidance\nIdeally, this goal will include a measure of of how easy or hard it is for residents to access ocean resources when they need them. Measures of access include institutional and/or government regulations that provide people with access to marine waters through open coastlines and docks, readily available permitting for fish harvest, and programs that foster artisanal fishing opportunities. Another measure of access is that fish are actually available, which can be estimated by assessing the health of targeted species (see Fisheries subgoal) or the general sustainability of fishing practices. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing.\nIn the global analysis, the need for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line.\n\nNOTE: The benefits of Artisanal Fishing can be difficult to parse from other goals. For example, tonnage of artisanally-caught fish will typically be included in the Food Provision goal. Another example is that in the Baltic Sea region, Artisanal Opportunities is very closely connected to Tourism and Recreation since there are a lot of locals and tourists using the shared sea for enjoyment. It will be necessary to determine how to apportion the data.\n\nThe reference point will depend on the data and model. In most cases, the availability of better local data will allow for improvements to the Global OHI assessment model (see table below).\n\n\nLEARN MORE\nExplore the full description of the data and model used in the GLOBAL MODEL.

The International Maritime Organization only mandates AIS for vessels larger than 36 meters, which excludes many vessels operating in the Gulf.\nIncomplete Signal Reception: Not all AIS messages are recorded due to satellite coverage limitations, terrestrial receiver placement, signal interference, and variation in broadcast strength.

Its rich habitats, including mangroves and seagrass meadows, serve as critical nurseries for fish and other marine life.\nThis biologically rich region is equally vital to human life. The Gulf sustains vibrant coastal communities through fishing, tourism, and cultural traditions that have flourished for generations. Small-scale fisheries provide livelihoods for thousands, while ecotourism attracts visitors from around the globe, drawn by the promise of whale watching, diving, and pristine natural beauty.\nHowever, the Gulf of California faces mounting pressures, including overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate change. The Ocean Health Index for this region is a critical tool for evaluating the balance between human use and ecological health. By providing clear, actionable insights, the Index helps ensure that this exceptional marine ecosystem continues to thrive for the benefit of both nature and people.",

For access to this Google spreadsheet, contact Melanie Frazier at frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu,\n\n\nPhase 2: Planning\nThe expert working group will have several responsibilities, including:\n\nLearning more about the OHI framework and work flow, and exploring the philosophy underlying the original global goals.\nDeveloping the OHI framework for the Gulf of California, including:\n\nDefining spatial boundaries\nDetermining which goals/subgoals will be included in the assessment based on local characteristics and regional priorities\nIdentifying pressure and resilience variables that are relevant to the region\nBeginning to consider relevant data sources and reference points\n\nDeveloping relationships with key stakeholders\nProviding support during Phase 3 (Conducting the assessment), including: identifying possible data, reviewing goal methods and scores, collaborating on reference points, preparing and supporting meetings, etc.\nProviding support during Phase 4 (Informing) including: editing and developing materials (e.g., website, reports, papers, meetings) to inform policy and future assessments by by sharing scores and what was learned during the process.\n\n\nMore information about planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning more…\n\n\n\nAlong with this site and the Ocean Health Index website, explore these resource to find:\n\nA short introduction to the OHI framework\nGuidance for planning an OHI assessment and a description of responsibilities of the expert working group\n\n\n\nDefining spatial boundaries The boundaries of the assessment area must be determined. This document explains some of the issues.\nThe Gulf of California could be considered one region for this assessment, or it could be divided into smaller subregions to allow for comparisons among political or ecological regions. The boundaries are important to develop early on because data will be collected at this spatial scale.\nEstablish Goals The goal framework will need to be established. The 10 goals originally selected for the global assessment can help guide the goals chosen for the Gulf of California assessment.\n\nWhen tailoring the OHI framework it is important to understand the rationale behind previously-developed approaches and to reflect whether any goals should be added, removed, or redefined. The best way to begin is by exploring the philosophy underlying each of the original goals, and then working from there. The menu to the left provides a brief description of each of the goals used in the global model as well as a description of how other regional indices have adapted the goal to fit their needs.\nThese goal pages will be updated over time to reflect the specific needs of the Gulf of California.\nIdentify Pressures and Resilience Along with the goals, it is equally important to define and categorize how local pressures and resilience properties affect the goals. We will provide more guidance on that later, but in the meantime, you can learn more about pressures and resilience.\n\n\n\nPhase 3: Conduct\nDuring this stage, the expert working group, goal specific experts, and analysts will work closely to further refine the OHI framework, identify data, and calculate and review scores. This is an iterative process and this resource includes detailed methods for conducting an OHI assessment.\n\n\nPhase 4: Inform\nThis phase involves developing and implementing a strategy for using the OHI assessment to improve the marine health of the Gulf of California. This is most effective if there is interest and engagement from policy makers and ongoing communication during the OHI process to best inform management actions that could have measurable impacts. Repeated assessments as new data become available enable tracking ocean health through time and evaluating management priorities. This resource describes this phase of an OHI assessment.",
