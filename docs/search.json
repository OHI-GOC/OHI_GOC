    "text": "The Gulf of California, often called the “Aquarium of the World,” is a jewel of biodiversity and a lifeline for the communities that border its shores. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to over 900 species of fish, as well as iconic marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and sea lions. Its rich habitats, including mangroves and seagrass meadows, serve as critical nurseries for fish and other marine life.\nThis biologically rich region is equally vital to human life. The Gulf sustains vibrant coastal communities through fishing, tourism, and cultural traditions that have flourished for generations. Small-scale fisheries provide livelihoods for thousands, while ecotourism attracts visitors from around the globe, drawn by the promise of whale watching, diving, and pristine natural beauty.\nHowever, the Gulf of California faces mounting pressures, including overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate change. The Ocean Health Index for this region is a critical tool for evaluating the balance between human use and ecological health. By providing clear, actionable insights, the Index helps ensure that this exceptional marine ecosystem continues to thrive for the benefit of both nature and people.",

In particular, it will be useful to become familiar with each of the 10 goals. The website also includes useful information about embarking on a regional OHI assessment.\nNail down timeline Identify key deadlines and meeting times. A tentative timeline is provided above, and the corresponding Google spreadsheet can be edited here (contact Melanie at frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu for access).\nDefining spatial boundaries Several decisions will need to be made concerning the boundaries of the assessment. This document explains some of the issues.\nFramework: Goals The goal framework will need to be established. This will involve determining whether goals should cut or added. Goal models should also be evaluated to determine how they can be improved to meet the needs of the region. It will also be necessary to consider reference points!\nThe best way to approach this is to explore the philosophy underlying each goal. The OHI global website provides a brief description of each goal and each goal page includes a link to PRACTICAL GUIDANCE which provides specific advice and a description of how other regional indices have adapted the goal to fit their needs.\nIt is also worth navigating the menu bar to your left to learn about the goals. These will be updated over time to be more specific to the Gulf of California.\nFramework: Pressures and Resilience The pressures and resilience metrics will also need to be established. We will provide more guidance on that later, but in the meantime, you can learn more about pressure and resilience metrics.\nIdentify Goal Keepers After the goals are established, it will be necessary to identify 3-5 subject matter experts to work on each goal. These “Goalies” will help develop goal models, identify potential data, and establish reference points.\nThey will work closely with the Expert Working Group to develop and test the goals.\nGoogle spreadsheet for Goalies (contact Melanie, frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu for access).\n\n\nPhase 3: Score calculation",

The ocean plays a major role in slowing the pace of global climate change by absorbing CO₂ from the atmosphere and storing it as carbon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Carbon Storage score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 73.\nThese scores suggest that key habitats are sequestering and storing atmospheric carbon, however, this process has been somewhat compromised due to habitat loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goal focuses on three coastal ecosystems — mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses — that have remarkable ability to store and sequester carbon in their living parts and buried detritus.

Though these coastal ecosystems form less than 2% of the ocean’s surface, they contribute more to long-term carbon storage and sequestration in sediments than any other ocean ecosystem.\nThe Carbon Storage score is based on the current extent and condition of CO₂-storing coastal habitats (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes) relative to their recent historical condition.

    "text": "A short introduction to the Ocean Health Index\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Health Index is a framework for assessing and communicating ocean health, which we define as how well we are managing ocean resources to sustainably deliver benefits to people now and in the future.\nSince it’s inception in 2012, we have conducted 12 global assessments and over 30 regional assessments (either independently, or in partnership us).\nThe original global OHI assesses 10 goals, each of which is based on a marine service or function that humans directly care about, such as jobs and food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about the global goals (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on the goal will link to the goal pages which provide more information about goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough 10 goals are measured for the global OHI, many regional assessments modify the number and composition of the goals based on their specific needs. The goals that are ultimately included in the Gulf of California assessment will likely differ from the global assessment, because some goals may not be relevant to the region. Alternatively, new goals, not included in the global assessment, may be developed given a region’s natural resources or priorities.\nIn addition to changes in the goal infrastructure, the model and data used to calculate the goals will change because:\n\nHigher quality local data is usually available!\nGoal models, and reference points, can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region.\nGoals can be weighted differently based on regional priorities.\n\n\nGoal calculations\nGoal scores are mainly determined by how well the goal is performing relative to an established target, we refer to this as the goal status score.\nIn addition to the status score, goal scores incorporate three additional metrics: pressures, resilience, and trend. The pressures acting on a goal will reduce its score, and can include climate change or human disturbance. However, the pressures acting on a goal can be reduced by metrics that provide system resilience, such as good governance and protected areas. We also incorporate the recent trajectory of a goal’s status into the final score, such that goals with improving status will have a better score, and goals with decreasing status will worsen the score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more…\n\n\n\nNavigate the menu at the left for more information about each goal.

    "text": "This goal measures whether people have the opportunity to fish at a small local scales.\n\n\nArtisanal fishing, often called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation, and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, especially in developing nations. Small-scale fishing is also an important component of cultural identity and heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Artisanal Fishing Opportunities score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 85.\nOverall, these scores are fairly high which indicates demand for artisanal fishing is being met using lawful and sustainable methods, or alternatively, there is little economic need for artisanal fishing (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Israel, Yemen). The lowest scoring regions are Eritrea (high need, fairly low access) and Sudan (high need, small scale fisheries could be better managed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goal measures how easily people can access ocean resources when they need them and whether the stocks being harvested are sustainably managed.\nThe model has three components:\n\nNeed: The percent of population below the poverty line. The global OHI model uses per capita GDP as a proxy for need.\nAccess: Institutional permits and regulations encouraging small fisheries and providing access to coastal regions. Data is from the UN sustainable development goal 14.b.1 which measures the degree of application of a legal, regulatory, policy, or institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries.\nSustainability: Sustainability of fishing methods and/or the health of targeted species. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing. The global assessment uses the same stock status data used to calculate the fisheries subgoal scores.\n\nA high score indicates that the demand for artisanal fishing is being met using lawful and sustainable methods, or alternatively, there is little economic need for artisanal fishing. A low score indicates that regions are not achieving or allowing sustainable artisanal fishing opportunities to be realized.\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the current status dimension of the score, but pressures, resilience, and past trends are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the current status score.\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment.\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure).\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.\nWe provide a brief description of all the pressure and resilience variables along with how they affect each goal. A brief description of how these variables are incorporated into the final score is here. :::\n\n\n\n\nAs a proxy for subsistence fishing need, we use the inverse of per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or GDPpcPPP. These data are rescaled to values between 0 and 1 by taking the natural log of the data and dividing all the values by the GDPpcPPP value that corresponds to the 95th quantile across all years (from 2005 to most recent data) and countries.\nSaudi Arabia, Israel, and Yemen have low economic need, whereas, the other countries have relatively high economic mean.\nFor more details see the data preparation script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are from the UN sustainable development goal 14.b.1, “Degree of application of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries (level of implementation: 1 lowest to 5 highest)”. We linearly rescale these data to have values between 0 and 1.\nAll Red Sea and Gulf of Aden regions have high access scores from 0.8-1, except Eritrea which is 0.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to artisanal fisheries: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is calculated using the same data as the fisheries subgoal, but using only the artisanal catch. For each region, we average the stock status scores weighted by the total catch. The country level catch data (tonnes per year) is from FAO and the B/Bmsy (the biomass of the population relative to the biomass at maximum sustainable yield) are from RAM when available. Otherwise, we use the CMSY approach to estimate B/Bmsy.\nThe scores are relatively high for all the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden regions. They are around 0.8 for for Sudan, Egypt, and Israel; and &gt; 0.9 for the remaining countries.\nFor more information about the methods, check out the scripts used to prepare these data: (preparing catch and estimating score\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable harvest of artisanal stocks: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the current model, this goal would be most improved by reducing the economic need for artisanal fishing in Somalia, Sudan, Dijibouti, Eritrea, Jordan, and Egypt. Access to artisanal fishing could also be improved in Eritrea.\nOtherwise, access to artisanal fishing is good and artisanally fished stocks are relatively healthy.\nFuture assessments should carefully assess the underlying data for improvements, here are some factors to consider:\n\nTo determine whether artisanally fished stocks are well managed we use a global database of stock status scores that requires much gapfilling of missing data.
