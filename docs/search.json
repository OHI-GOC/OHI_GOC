    "text": "A short introduction to the Ocean Health Index\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Health Index is a framework for assessing and communicating ocean health, or, how well we are managing ocean resources to sustainably deliver benefits to people now and in the future.\nSince it’s inception in 2012, we have conducted 13 global assessments, and over 30 regional assessments have been conducted independently, or in partnership us.\nThe original global OHI assesses 10 goals, each of which is based on a marine service or function that humans directly care about, such as jobs and food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about the global goals (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on the goal will link to the goal pages which provide more information about the global goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ten goals included in global assessments have been identified as widely-shared across different geographies, but they are not universal, and assessments using the OHI framework should only include goals that are relevant to their region. Most regional assessments modify the number and composition of the goals based on their specific needs. The goals that are ultimately included in the Gulf of California assessment will likely differ from the global assessment, because some goals may not be relevant to the region. Alternatively, new goals, not included in the global assessment, may be developed given a region’s natural resources or priorities.\nIn addition to changes in the goal infrastructure, the model and data used to calculate the goals will change because:\n\nHigher quality local data is usually available!\nGoal models, and reference points, can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region.\nGoals can be weighted differently based on regional priorities.\n\n\nGoal calculations\nGoal scores are mainly determined by how well the goal is performing relative to an established target, we refer to this as the goal status score.\nIn addition to the status score, goal scores incorporate three additional metrics: pressures, resilience, and trend. The pressures acting on a goal will reduce its score, and can include climate change or human disturbance. The pressures acting on a goal can be mitigated by elements that contribute to the resilience of the system, such as good governance and protected areas. We also incorporate the recent trajectory of a goal’s status into the final score, such that goals with improving status will have a better score, and goals with decreasing status will worsen the score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more…\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the menu at the left for more information about each goal. Overtime, these descriptions will be updated with information specific to the Gulf of California assessment.\nThe oceanhealthindex.org website is a good place to learn more about the OHI framework.\nThis resource provides a nice readable summary of the OHI.",

This UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to over 900 species of fish, as well as iconic marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and sea lions. Its rich habitats, including mangroves and seagrass meadows, serve as critical nurseries for fish and other marine life.\nThis biologically rich region is equally vital to human life. The Gulf sustains vibrant coastal communities through fishing, tourism, and cultural traditions that have flourished for generations. Small-scale fisheries provide livelihoods for thousands, while ecotourism attracts visitors from around the globe, drawn by the promise of whale watching, diving, and pristine natural beauty.\nHowever, the Gulf of California faces mounting pressures, including overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate change. The Ocean Health Index for this region is a critical tool for evaluating the balance between human use and ecological health. By providing clear, actionable insights, the Index helps ensure that this exceptional marine ecosystem continues to thrive for the benefit of both nature and people.",

Our connection to marine and coastal environments is profound, providing inspiration and a sense of history and place. For the global assessment, we measure how well we are protecting this legacy for future generations by assessing the condition of iconic species (Iconic Species subgoal) and the protection of coastal regions (Lasting Special Places subgoal).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sense of Place score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 37.\nOverall, the scores for this goal are low throughout the region. This suggests that the marine places people value may not be well protected for future generations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Global OHI, this goal captures the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity by measuring two subgoals: the condition of iconic species and the condition of lasting special places.\nWe calculate each of these subgoals separately and average them to estimate the overall goal score. A score of 100 means all iconic species are at very low risk of extinction and at least 30% of coastal habitats are designated as marine protected areas.\nThe subgoal scores can be viewed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubgoal scores (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iconic species subgoal score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 55.\nThis goal is low for all countries which indicates that too many of the marine animals that people value are critically endangered or endangered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall Lasting Special Places subgoal score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 18.\nThe low scores for this goal suggest little effort has been made to preserve culturally valuable coastal and marine areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iconic species subgoal measures the status of iconic marine species, which are the animals that have unique importance to humans as demonstrated through traditional activities, ethnic or religious practices, existence value, or locally acknowledged aesthetic value.\nIconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales).\nThis sub-goal is estimated by averaging the status scores of the iconic species in each region based on their IUCN Red List threat categories.\nThe list of iconic species was drawn from several data sources, but primarily from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species (especially important to people for their health, livelihoods, and/or culture) and Flagship Species (‘charismatic’ and/or well-known). Additional culturally important species species, available at the continent level (Garcia et al. 2023), were added to supplement the original iconic species list.\n\n\n\nThe Lasting special places sub-goal measures how well we are protecting, for current and future generations, the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity.\nSpecial places are coastal and marine areas that are culturally significant for a variety of reasons. Designating a place to be a landmark, monument, and/or Marine Protected Area can help ensure its existence, provide valuable ecosystem services and preserve cultural heritage and identity.\nTo get a score of 100 a region must protect at least 30% of its coastal area.\nWe use the United Nation’s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) to identify protected areas. The WDPA aggregates several key databases: IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas, Global Marine Protected Areas, UNESCO World Heritage Marine sites, National Parks and Nature Reserves, and the United Nations List of Protected Places. In most cases the year of designation is listed for each protected area.\nWe focus only on coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) for marine special places because we assume lasting special places are primarily in coastal areas. For coastlines, we focus only on the first 1-km-wide strip of land as a way to increase the likelihood that the area being protected by terrestrial parks is connected to the marine system in some way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lasting special places sub-goal focuses on geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons. This sub-goal is particularly hard to quantify. Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed). The reality is that such lists do not exist. Instead, we assume areas that are protected indicate special places (i.e., the effort to protect them suggests they are important places). Clearly this is an imperfect assumption but in many cases it will be true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the current status dimension of the score, but pressures, resilience, and past trends are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the current status score.\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment.\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure).\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.\nWe provide a brief description of all the pressure and resilience variables along with how they affect each goal. A brief description of how these variables are incorporated into the final score is here. :::\n\n\nWe will first look at the data underlying the Iconic species subgoal and then the Lasting special places subgoal.\n\n\nThe following is a list of iconic species found in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region as well as their IUCN conservation status. Iconic species include animals such as the Blue Whale (endangered), Grey Reef Shark (endangered), Blacktip Reef Shark (vulnerable), and the Humphead Wrasse (endangered).\nWe identified 24 iconic species within the region. For each species we determine the IUCN threatened status designations within each region the species is located. In 52 (of N=141) cases, the species were critically endangered or endangered; 45 were vulnerable, and 34 were either of least concern or not threatened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIconic species condition scores (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data describe the km2 and percent protected areas located in the 1km inland coastal areas and 3nm offshore regions.\nIn regard to protected areas, only Saudi Arabia (~ 12% protected), Israel (~4%), and Egypt (~21%) have marine protected areas along the coastline and offshore regions (within 3nm of the coast), but none are near the 30% required to obtain a score of 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtected areas: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, more could be done to protect the species and areas that people value in this region.\nIconic species scores are fairly low throughout the region, indicating that the welfare of many iconic species, such as the Blue Whale and Green Sea Turtle, is threatened.\nFurthermore, according to the global data, there are very few Marine Protected Areas in the region. Implementing Marine Protected Areas along the coastline and nearshore areas in all the countries would immediately improve scores.\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised the iconic species and lasting special places subgoals to better reflect local concerns.",

    "text": "The Iconic species subgoal measures the status of iconic marine species, which are the animals that have unique importance to humans as demonstrated through traditional activities, ethnic or religious practices, existence value, or locally acknowledged aesthetic value.\nIconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales).\nThis sub-goal is estimated by averaging the status scores of the iconic species in each region based on their IUCN Red List threat categories.\nThe list of iconic species was drawn from several data sources, but primarily from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species (especially important to people for their health, livelihoods, and/or culture) and Flagship Species (‘charismatic’ and/or well-known). Additional culturally important species species, available at the continent level (Garcia et al. 2023), were added to supplement the original iconic species list.\n\n\n\nThe Lasting special places sub-goal measures how well we are protecting, for current and future generations, the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity.\nSpecial places are coastal and marine areas that are culturally significant for a variety of reasons. Designating a place to be a landmark, monument, and/or Marine Protected Area can help ensure its existence, provide valuable ecosystem services and preserve cultural heritage and identity.\nTo get a score of 100 a region must protect at least 30% of its coastal area.\nWe use the United Nation’s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) to identify protected areas. The WDPA aggregates several key databases: IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas, Global Marine Protected Areas, UNESCO World Heritage Marine sites, National Parks and Nature Reserves, and the United Nations List of Protected Places. In most cases the year of designation is listed for each protected area.\nWe focus only on coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) for marine special places because we assume lasting special places are primarily in coastal areas. For coastlines, we focus only on the first 1-km-wide strip of land as a way to increase the likelihood that the area being protected by terrestrial parks is connected to the marine system in some way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lasting special places sub-goal focuses on geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons. This sub-goal is particularly hard to quantify. Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed). The reality is that such lists do not exist. Instead, we assume areas that are protected indicate special places (i.e., the effort to protect them suggests they are important places). Clearly this is an imperfect assumption but in many cases it will be true.",

Seabird distributions data came from Birdlife International http://datazone.birdlife.org [@birdlifeinternationalandhandbookofthebirdsoftheworld2020].\nWe scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions [@barnosky_has_2011] and would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity.\nThreat weights, \\(w_{i}\\), were assigned based on the IUCN threat categories status of each \\(i\\) species, following the weighting schemes developed by Butchart et al. [-@butchart2007improvements]. For the purposes of this analysis, we included only data for extant species for which sufficient data were available to conduct an assessment. We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach [@schipper2008status; @hoffmann_impact_2010].\nWe first calculated each the region’s area-weighted average species risk status, \\(\\bar R_{spp}\\).

However, in cases where a subcomponent was zero, we added a value of 0.01 (on a scale of 0 to 1) to prevent the overall score from going to zero. Given that there is uncertainty around our pollution estimates, a zero score resulting from one subcomponent seemed too extreme.\nAlthough clean waters are relevant and important anywhere in the ocean, coastal waters drive this goal both because the problems of pollution are concentrated there and because people predominantly access and care about clean waters in coastal areas. The nearshore area is what people can see and where beach-going, shoreline fishing, and other activities occur. Furthermore, the data for high seas areas is limited and there is little meaningful regulation or governance over the input of pollution into these areas.

However, in cases where a subcomponent was zero, we added a value of 0.01 (on a scale of 0 to 1) to prevent the overall score from going to zero. Given that there is uncertainty around our pollution estimates, a zero score resulting from one subcomponent seemed too extreme.\nAlthough clean waters are relevant and important anywhere in the ocean, coastal waters drive this goal both because the problems of pollution are concentrated there and because people predominantly access and care about clean waters in coastal areas. The nearshore area is what people can see and where beach-going, shoreline fishing, and other activities occur. Furthermore, the data for high seas areas is limited and there is little meaningful regulation or governance over the input of pollution into these areas. We therefore calculate this goal only for the first 3 nm of ocean for each country’s EEZ. We chose 3 nm for several reasons, but found the status results to be relatively insensitive to different distances.",

    "text": "Artisanal fishing opportunities\nThis goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n This information is meant to help guide the process of developing the Gulf of California OHI!\nThis goal is included in the global OHI, but other regional assessments have cut or modified this goal to better meet their objectives for ocean health. For example, in a Canadian OHI assessment, the perspective of Aboriginal communities, which has been absent from assessments at the global scale due to lack of information, was represented by redefining the artisanal fishing opportunities goal as the Aboriginal opportunity goal. The model will almost certainly be modified for the Gulf of California assessment. For example, need is a component of the global analysis, but may not be relevant in a regional assessment.\n\n\nOverview\nArtisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, especially in developing nations. Small-scale fishing is an important component of cultural identity and heritage.\n\nHalf the world’s fish harvest is captured by artisanal fishing families.\n\nThis goal measures how easy or hard it is for fishers to access ocean resources when they need them and the sustainability of harvest of stocks used by artisanal fishers. The need for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line. Access, or ability to meet this need, are institutional permits or encouragements for small fisheries. Sustainability of artisanal fisheries refers to the sustainability of fishing methods and/or the health of targeted species. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing.\nA high score indicates that the demand for artisanal fishing is being met using lawful and sustainable methods, or alternatively, there is little economic need for artisanal fishing. A low score indicates that regions are not achieving or allowing sustainable artisanal fishing opportunities to be realized.\nWhile small-scale fishing provides benefits and opportunities for local communities, limited or ineffective regulation and enforcement can signficantly impact the ability to pursue it.\nComparison of large scale and small scale fisheries\n\n\n\nInfographic from Jacquet et al. 2008\n\n\n\n\nPractical Guidance\nIdeally, this goal will include a measure of of how easy or hard it is for residents to access ocean resources when they need them. Measures of access include institutional and/or government regulations that provide people with access to marine waters through open coastlines and docks, readily available permitting for fish harvest, and programs that foster artisanal fishing opportunities. Another measure of access is that fish are actually available, which can be estimated by assessing the health of targeted species (see Fisheries subgoal) or the general sustainability of fishing practices. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing.\nIn the global analysis, the need for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line.\n\nNOTE: The benefits of Artisanal Fishing can be difficult to parse from other goals. For example, tonnage of artisanally-caught fish will typically be included in the Food Provision goal. Another example is that in the Baltic Sea region, Artisanal Opportunities is very closely connected to Tourism and Recreation since there are a lot of locals and tourists using the shared sea for enjoyment. It will be necessary to determine how to apportion the data.\n\nThe reference point will depend on the data and model. In most cases, the availability of better local data will allow for improvements to the Global OHI assessment model (see table below).\n\n\nLEARN MORE\nExplore the full description of the data and model used in the GLOBAL MODEL.

For example, millions of marine ornamental (aquarium) fish are harvested and exported for sale each year. This trade can provide a valuable and long-term income stream for low-income coastal communities if undertaken in a sustainable manner.\nFor the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region, this score is driven almost entirely by the fish oil/fish meal trade. The one exception is that ornamental fish trade comprises about 18% of Israel’s Natural Product score, the rest of the countries have very little (i.e., &lt; 1% of score) or no ornamental fish trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Natural Products score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 88.\nThe scores in this region are fairly high. There are no data for Sudan and Djbouti. This could result if these regions do not trade these products, or, alternatively, from data limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goal score is based on the sustainable harvest quantity, relative to some target, of marine natural products such as seaweed and marine plants, sponges, shells, fish oil and meal, and marine ornamental fish. This goal does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not sustainable. Ideally targets are based on the amount of harvest that does not threaten future harvest, such as the maximum sustainable yield from fisheries stock status scores.\nCurrently, the global Ocean Health Index includes harvest and production of non-food seaweed, ornamental fish, and wild-caught fish used for fish oil and meal.\nA high score indicates that natural resources are maximally harvested at a rate that does not threaten future harvest and minimizes ecological harm.\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component.

For the global assessment, the contribution of these two subgoals to the overall score is weighted by their total seafood yield. However, other approaches for weighting the contribution of these subgoals are reasonable.\nA high score indicates that a region has maximized the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks. For fisheries, both over- and under- harvesting should be penalized. For mariculture, production should be at the sustainable “potential”.\n\n\nAs humanity’s population continues to expand, we must increasingly rely upon new and improved methods for cultivating food on land and in the ocean. The term aquaculture refers to the cultivation in water (fresh and saltwater) of animals or plants for human consumption. Mariculture refers to the commercial harvest of seafood that is farm-raised in the ocean and along the coast.\nAquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production sector in the world, with a 527% rise in production from 1990 to 2018 (FAO 2020)! As the population contines to grow, it will become increasingly important to efficiently grow food using sustainable mariculture practices.\nMariculture scores are based on two factors:\n\nMaximizing the amount of seafood that can grown based on conditions.\nEnsuring that mariculture practices are sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe status of the mariculture subgoal, \\(x_{mar}\\), was calculated using three sources of data:\n\nMariculture production: Tonnes of production for both marine and brackish waters, excluding species that were not used as a source of food for human consumption is from FAO.\nPotential production: Gentry et al. (2019) estimates the tonnes of possible production for marine aquaculture at a high resolution spatial scale. To account for social and economic realities and other constraints to these ecological potentials, we constrained the per-country potential to 1% of this tonnage estimate and used these country values as reference points.\nSustainability: Additionally, we include a sustainability score for each species in each region which is based on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch aquaculture recommendations [@2023].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wild-caught fisheries subgoal evaluates how well we maximize harvest without damaging the ocean’s ability to continue providing fish for people in the future. The sustainable harvest of wild-caught seafood avoids excessively high exploitation of target species and does not target threatened populations. Each year’s catch must not take so much from the population that future catches will decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe assess food provision from wild caught fisheries by estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (\\(B/B_{MSY}\\)) for each stock. When available, we obtained \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database.\nWhen RAM data were not available, we used data-limited approaches that have been developed to estimate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values using globally available catch data.\nTo calculate the status for each region and year, \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values were converted to a stock status score between 0-1 that penalizes over-harvesting. To obtain the overall status for each region, the stock status scores for all the stocks within a region were averaged using a geometric mean weighted by the average catch (tonnes) of each stock using Sea Around Us catch data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component.

About 226,000 tonnes of seafood are farmed each year in this region, with Egypt producing the most (~138,00 tonnes) and Saudi Arabia next (~85,000). However, this is small relative to the 3.7 million tonnes that could, theoretically, be produced.\nThe sustainability scores for reared seafood are fairly high for all countries and taxa, with the exception of Egypt.

Only about 40% of the fish catch is identified to species, which means that it can not be assessed using stock assessments and this is heavily penalized in the global Ocean Health Index fisheries model.\nFuture assessments should carefully assess the underlying data and models to meet their objectives.\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised mariculture and fisheries subgoals to better reflect local concerns.",

This page will help start the planning and preparation for the OHI Gulf of California assessment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tentative timeline (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1: Getting started\nThis phase of the project involves:\n\nassembling a working group and technical team\nbuilding awareness and support through informational webinars and meetings\ndeveloping a consortium of people within Mexico to co-lead and develop network connections\ndeveloping a strategic plan and timeline for the project\n\nAn important task during Phase 1 is Assembling an expert working group!\nAlong with regional experts, this group will include OHI experts and analysts from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, University of California, Santa Barbara.\nWe have created a Google worksheet to help identify expert working group participants. For access to this Google spreadsheet, contact Melanie Frazier at frazier@nceas.ucsb.edu,\n\n\nPhase 2: Planning\nThe expert working group will have several responsibilities, including:\n\nLearning more about the OHI framework and work flow, and exploring the philosophy underlying the original global goals.\nDeveloping the OHI framework for the Gulf of California, including:\n\nDefining spatial boundaries\nDetermining which goals/subgoals will be included in the assessment based on local characteristics and regional priorities\nIdentifying pressure and resilience variables that are relevant to the region\nBeginning to consider relevant data sources and reference points\n\nDeveloping relationships with key stakeholders\nProviding support during Phase 3 (Conducting the assessment), including: identifying possible data, reviewing goal methods and scores, collaborating on reference points, preparing and supporting meetings, etc.\nProviding support during Phase 4 (Informing) including: editing and developing materials (e.g., website, reports, papers, meetings) to inform policy and future assessments by by sharing scores and what was learned during the process.\n\n\nMore information about planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning more…\n\n\n\nAlong with this site and the Ocean Health Index website, explore these resource to find:\n\nA short introduction to the OHI framework\nGuidance for planning an OHI assessment and a description of responsibilities of the expert working group\n\n\n\nDefining spatial boundaries The boundaries of the assessment area must be determined. This document explains some of the issues.\nThe Gulf of California could be considered one region for this assessment, or it could be divided into smaller subregions to allow for comparisons among political or ecological regions. The boundaries are important to develop early on because data will be collected at this spatial scale.\nEstablish Goals The goal framework will need to be established. The 10 goals originally selected for the global assessment can help guide the goals chosen for the Gulf of California assessment.\n\nWhen tailoring the OHI framework it is important to understand the rationale behind previously-developed approaches and to reflect whether any goals should be added, removed, or redefined. The best way to begin is by exploring the philosophy underlying each of the original goals, and then working from there. The menu to the left provides a brief description of each of the goals used in the global model as well as a description of how other regional indices have adapted the goal to fit their needs.\nThese goal pages will be updated over time to reflect the specific needs of the Gulf of California.\nIdentify Pressures and Resilience Along with the goals, it is equally important to define and categorize how local pressures and resilience properties affect the goals. We will provide more guidance on that later, but in the meantime, you can learn more about pressures and resilience.\n\n\n\nPhase 3: Conduct\nDuring this stage, the expert working group, goal specific experts, and analysts will work closely to further refine the OHI framework, identify data, and calculate and review scores. This is an iterative process and this resource includes detailed methods for conducting an OHI assessment.\n\n\nPhase 4: Inform\nThis phase involves developing and implementing a strategy for using the OHI assessment to improve the marine health of the Gulf of California. This is most effective if there is interest and engagement from policy makers and ongoing communication during the OHI process to best inform management actions that could have measurable impacts. Repeated assessments as new data become available enable tracking ocean health through time and evaluating management priorities. This resource describes this phase of an OHI assessment.",

For the global OHI assessment, regulatory effort is comprised of five categories that address the 5 pressure categories: fishing pressure, habitat destruction, climate change, water pollution, and species introductions.

The ocean plays a major role in slowing the pace of global climate change by absorbing CO₂ from the atmosphere and storing it as carbon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Carbon Storage score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 73.\nThese scores suggest that key habitats are sequestering and storing atmospheric carbon, however, this process has been somewhat compromised due to habitat loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goal focuses on three coastal ecosystems — mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses — that have remarkable ability to store and sequester carbon in their living parts and buried detritus. When destroyed or degraded, these ecosystems not only stop sequestering carbon but can start to release it, becoming new sources of carbon dioxide that can accelerate global warming for decades or longer. Though these coastal ecosystems form less than 2% of the ocean’s surface, they contribute more to long-term carbon storage and sequestration in sediments than any other ocean ecosystem.\nThe Carbon Storage score is based on the current extent and condition of CO₂-storing coastal habitats (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes) relative to their recent historical condition. The status of each habitat is calculated (see biodiversity/habitat goal) and their contribution to the total goal score is the average of the habitats weighted by their average carbon storing capacity.\nCarbon sequestration data Weighting factors based on carbon sequestration rates for habitats used in the carbon storage goal (Chen & Lee 2022).\n\n\n\nHabitat\ncarbon storage\n\n\n\n\nMangrove\n230.9\n\n\nSaltmarsh\n244.7\n\n\nSeagrass\n138\n\n\nTidal flat\n129.8\n\n\n\nA score of 100 would indicate that these habitats are all still intact or have been restored to the same condition as in the past.
